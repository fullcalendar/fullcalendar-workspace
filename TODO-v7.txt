Publishing:
 pnpm changeset publish --no-git-tag
 (next version should be v7.0.0-beta.3 because beta.2 was taken by the angular hotfix..
 ..write release/changelog for that)
 Angular beta repro:
  https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-sphfu1?file=package.json,src%2Findex.html

Ensure transpilation to correct ES target
  should transpile ??
Theming
  did themeSystem:false ever clear the theme?
  Bootstrap color mode:
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7465
    ensure minimum Bootstrap version
  in bootstrap themes, event-height line-height is very tall. normalize? then make changelog entry?
DayGrid
  structure: don't render selection within specific days (faster for rerender on DnD)
  bug: crazy error: throw new Error('alignGridTop not supported yet')
  bug: no matter how tall daygrid rows are filled with events, should never squish fc-daygrid-cell-main
    down to zero height. Noticed while working with repro in #6798
    afterwards, write automated test
    very hard with row min-height. it misbehaves (because of basis?)
  bug: cell -main containers don't seem to have bottom margin for events
  bug: businessHours in month view, right side, has weird 1px gap
    (happens because percentage left/width -- try to return to using 'right'?)
  bug (should re-verify):
    events that are force to be list-item but span multiple days still take up space in later columns
  bug (print-view):
    for multi-day events, don't display title within non-start/end segs
  ensure DayGrid events don't overlap the left border of the day-cell when 0px padding
  for daygrid/timegrid that DON'T have horizontal scroll, improve header inner-text overflow:
    if not a header row that has sticky inner-content, set cell's overflow:hidden
    (the canonical test would be sizing month-view down really narrow)
  for event rendering, expose an isStandin flag for if hidden behind multiday
MultiMonth
  bug: when multimonth made REALLY small, single col month gets padding
    standard/bundle/examples/responsive.html
  bug w/ responsive:
    1. start out in different view, size window really small
    2. switch to multimonth, size window large
    3. multi-columns don't appear. just one column with vertically-squished months
  Since we moved to a normal Scroller instead of a force-vertical-scrollbar div,
    is there a chance of infinite dimension-to-state loop?
TimeGrid
  use pixel positioning for events (to avoid TimeGridCol height hack)
  does every timegrid event have the 'inset' border class even when not needed?
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg,
    make timegrid bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  structure: in TimeGridLayoutNormal, not nice how axis text isn't selectable
    (related to how now-indicator is rendered in axis)
Timeline
  bug (no resources): can't drag-n-drop. date-selection happens instead
  bug for timeline event dragging:
    1. have +more link with eventMaxStack
    2. open link, begin to drag event
    3. event looses it's duration. inconsistent with how normal event dragging happens
    (will be breaking change? maybe file ticket and add changelog)
  Is the event style in timeline-no-overlap.html too chunky?
  .fc-timeline-now-indicator-container shouldn't cover all the text in the header cells
  previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap
    for real? matters? add to changelog?
  Did +more links in timeline always have strict order (meaning they were at bottom?). Regression?
Resource DayGrid
  bug w/ `bundle/examples-v7/resource-daygrid.html` when dragging event3 one day ahead,
    would result in a +more link that'd disappear when you return, but after we refactor DayGrid rendering, should be fixed
Resource Timeline
  bug: in `examples/resource-add-remove.html`, when deleting Auditorium D, collapses strangely after
  bug: when resourceAreaHeaderContent, and multiple datagrid-columns, super-header's indent is unnecessary. looks bad
  column grouping, should expand to full height, but doesn't
    See bundle/examples/responsive.html
  in datagrid, move fc-resource to the fc-row (instead of each fc-cell)... add to changelog
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg,
    make timeline bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  structure: resource-row dom-structure unnecessarily complex
  get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible.
    see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
  ensure row-height-syncing doesn't have 1px-off problem
    queries inner-height, but when assigning to outer-height, does it add 1px?
  change how column-resizing widths is distibuted?
    right now it's impossible to resize last column
    try to take width away from next column when expanding
H-Scrolling Views
  ensure col-width-syncing doesn't have 1px-off problem
    queries inner-width, but when assigning to outer-width, does it add 1px?
List View
  eventually redo list-view (and find tickets -- better <a> tag wrapper. better stickiness)
    and redo empty-list message
Print Mode
  ensure no white text
  ensure nothing sticky
    (wait, maybe we want it titles sticky onscreen for h-scroll daygrid/timeline)
  DayGrid: disable dayMaxEvents=true behavior
  DayGrid: ensure: "event titles each day" https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6657
  disable sticky when media:print?
General Responsive
  Hide event times (daygrid/timeline) if too small?
  should fc-padding-* classes be responsive, meaning related to font-size?
  make ticket where popover is responsive?
General Events
  remove <a> tags from events w/o url (or editable?)
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7675
    use `getEventRangeAnchorAttrs`
Scrollbars
  bug: unnecessary vertical scrollbar in daygrid see issue-6749-related.html
  implement scroller padding rectangles
  Test horizontal scroll normalization (for isRTL) in variety of browsers
  See [scrollbar bug] for Resource Timeline
Markup/CSS/structure
  Rename fc-flex-column -> fc-flex-col (consistent with fc-timegrid-col, and tailwind)
  go back to simple classNames for views (no `*-view`)
    compare to old and then add to changelog
  rethink .fc-cell/fc-daygrid-cell classNames
  change names to runon, like "fc-nowindicator" and "morelink" and "viewharness"
    or "view-outer"?
  we shouldn't have 'fc-slot-sat' ... it's a day! instead 'fc-day-sat'
  Z-INDEX issues
    solve z-index:9999 hacks
    in timegrid, background events are incorrectly covering foreground events (background-events.html)
  fc-daygrid-cell-number is an awkward classname... fc-daygrid-day-number instead? fc-daygrid-datenumber/daynumber?
  .fc-cell-main doesn't need to be span anymore (within a flex parent)
    same with indent
  position the popover -1px -1px, to overlap border
  is text-selection disabled everywhere? was it before? (if fixed, find ticket)
Accessibility
  lack of text-selectability: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5628
Performance
  why does TimelineLane::render get called 3 times initially?
  [ ] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/3003
    not rerendinering events that didn't change --- not fixed in v6 or v7-beta
  [?] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6199 (dateClick)
    V6 repro: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/OJKMLRR?editors=0010
    V7 has no real improvement
  "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
  hit-system: only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  this.detachInnerHeight() // should fire a 'null' height? yes! will cleanup any map listeners
  ResizeObserver ponyfill
    as few calls as possible
    check no memory leak
Angular
  Building example project gives warnings like
    Ignoring this import because ".." was marked as having no side effects
Locales
  audit all allDayText. there's no more max-width in the CSS. use allDayHtml with breaks if needed
Dist
  ensure outputted CSS doesn't have multiple :root declarations because of how we shifted vars.css around
Manual Testing
  Touch devices
Dev Cleanup
  Remove unused css mixins
  Why is week-numbers.html example in premium? has nothing to do with premium
Examples
  In each two-column layout, give the sidebar flex-shrink:0 and the main min-width:0
    Things are currently collapsing very strangely on a narrow screen (like stackblitz angular demo)

    border problem fixed: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/PoMOwdV?editors=0010
Support Tickets
  Fixed this issue of mousedown taking long time to recalculate style?
    https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9078

ensure automated tests for...
  positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
  resource-timeline indent works
  pixel # for height/contentHeight works
  correct header row heights for multi-header resource-TIMEgrid row with horizontal scrolling
  when nowIndicator is OFF, doesn't render in DOM at all
  percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
  that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views
  test datagrid with h scroll, but timeline area WITHOUT h scroll
  multiple tiers of headers line-up across scrollers
    timegrid h-scroll. with and without weekNumber
    resource-timeline. w/ datagrid/timeline headers: 1/2, 2/1
