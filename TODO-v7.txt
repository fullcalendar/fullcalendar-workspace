REVIVE allowReslicing...
  Issue where some ppl want allowReslicing:
    issue: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6187
    repro before: https://codepen.io/acerix/pen/NWbOaVZ?editors=0010
    repro after: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/YzZwKoE?editors=0010
    commit: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/commit/c3199457dc36f9245f011557b032346b3a0552fe
  WHY we recently switch allowReslicing=false for DayGrid
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-workspace/commit/fa146e9e5a91b117bbfbc3e6a3a259360905a8fa
  Ticket where customer does NOT want reslicing:
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9203

ResizeObserver
  implement fallback
  structure: stop doing "frame" elements for measurements, and instead use just "cushion"
    how would that work for getting a scroller's "clientWidth/clientHeight"?
Angular
  bug: angular not compiling with our Preact version
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6457
    https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/4023
    tried skipLibCheck:true, but getting runtime errors (related!?). related? reverted
Web Component
  remove `shadow` attribute
Theming
  did themeSystem:false ever clear the theme?
  Bootstrap color mode:
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7465
    ensure minimum Bootstrap version
  in bootstrap themes, event-height line-height is very tall. normalize? then make changelog entry?
DayGrid
  bug: resizing event to different row, no mirror rendered in other rows
  bug: no matter how tall daygrid rows are filled with events, should never squish fc-daygrid-cell-main
    down to zero height. Noticed while working with repro in #6798
    afterwards, write automated test
    very hard with row min-height. it misbehaves (because of basis?)
  bug: multiweek-view.html: when dragging and dropping event, scroll jumps down
  bug: multiweek 'today' doesn't scroll into view
  bug: cell -main containers don't seem to have bottom margin for events
  bug: businessHours in month view, right side, has weird 1px gap
    (happens because percentage left/width -- try to return to using 'right'?)
  ensure DayGrid events don't overlap the left border of the day-cell when 0px padding
  for daygrid/timegrid that DON'T have horizontal scroll, improve header inner-text overflow:
    if not a header row that has sticky inner-content, set cell's overflow:hidden
    (the canonical test would be sizing month-view down really narrow)
  for event rendering, expose an isStandin flag for if hidden behind multiday
MultiMonth
  bug: when multimonth made REALLY small, single col month gets padding
    standard/bundle/examples/responsive.html
  bug w/ responsive:
    1. start out in different view, size window really small
    2. switch to multimonth, size window large
    3. multi-columns don't appear. just one column with vertically-squished months
TimeGrid
  use pixel positioning for events (to avoid TimeGridCol height hack)
  does every timegrid event have the 'inset' border class even when not needed?
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg,
    make timegrid bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  structure: in TimeGridLayoutNormal, not nice how axis text isn't selectable
    (related to how now-indicator is rendered in axis)
Timeline
  bug for timeline event dragging:
    1. have +more link with eventMaxStack
    2. open link, begin to drag event
    3. event looses it's duration. inconsistent with how normal event dragging happens
    (will be breaking change? maybe file ticket and add changelog)
  Is the event style in timeline-no-overlap.html too chunky?
  .fc-timeline-now-indicator-container shouldn't cover all the text in the header cells
  previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap
    for real? matters? add to changelog?
Resource Timeline
  bug: when switching back and forth from 1-day to 3-day, many times, scrolltime gets messed up
    related to slots growing in size!
  bug w/ scrollbar: resizing two-column causes datagrid bottom padding to collapse to 1px !?
    because bottom scrollbars widths don't notify update because the inner-box doesn't change
      (ResizeObserver needs to support box:border-box)
    RELATED BUG: when bottom-padding of spreadsheet DOES work, it's off by one because querying
      for scrollbar width is faulty due to offsetWidth/clientWidth bug including border
  column grouping, should expand to full height, but doesn't
    See bundle/examples/responsive.html
  in datagrid, move fc-resource to the fc-row (instead of each fc-cell)... add to changelog
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg,
    make timeline bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  structure: resource-row dom-structure unnecessarily complex
  get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible.
    see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
  ensure row-height-syncing doesn't have 1px-off problem
    queries inner-height, but when assigning to outer-height, does it add 1px?
  change how column-resizing widths is distibuted?
    right now it's impossible to resize last column
    try to take width away from next column when expanding
H-Scrolling Views
  ensure col-width-syncing doesn't have 1px-off problem
    queries inner-width, but when assigning to outer-width, does it add 1px?
List View
  eventually redo list-view (and find tickets -- better <a> tag wrapper. better stickiness)
    and redo empty-list message
Print Mode
  ensure no white text
  ensure nothing sticky
    (wait, maybe we want it titles sticky onscreen for h-scroll daygrid/timeline)
  DayGrid: disable dayMaxEvents=true behavior
  DayGrid: ensure: "event titles each day" https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6657
  disable sticky when media:print?
General Responsive
  Hide event times (daygrid/timeline) if too small?
  should fc-padding-* classes be responsive, meaning related to font-size?
  make ticket where popover is responsive?
General Events
  remove <a> tags from events w/o url (or editable?)
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7675
    use `getEventRangeAnchorAttrs`
Scrollbars
  bug: unnecessary vertical scrollbar in daygrid see issue-6749-related.html
  implement scroller padding rectangles
  Test horizontal scroll normalization (for isRTL) in variety of browsers
  See [scrollbar bug] for Resource Timeline
Markup/CSS/structure
  Rename fc-flex-column -> fc-flex-col (consistent with fc-timegrid-col, and tailwind)
  go back to simple classNames for views (no `*-view`)
    compare to old and then add to changelog
  rethink .fc-cell/fc-daygrid-cell classNames
  change names to runon, like "fc-nowindicator" and "morelink" and "viewharness"
    or "view-outer"?
  we shouldn't have 'fc-slot-sat' ... it's a day! instead 'fc-day-sat'
  Z-INDEX issues
    solve z-index:9999 hacks
    in timegrid, background events are incorrectly covering foreground events (background-events.html)
  fc-daygrid-cell-number is an awkward classname... fc-daygrid-day-number instead? fc-daygrid-datenumber/daynumber?
  .fc-cell-main doesn't need to be span anymore (within a flex parent)
    same with indent
  position the popover -1px -1px, to overlap border
  is text-selection disabled everywhere? was it before? (if fixed, find ticket)
Performance
  why does TimelineLane::render get called 3 times initially?
  if event will never be rendered because >eventMaxStack or >dayMaxEvents, don't put in dom at all!
  [ ] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/3003
    not rerendinering events that didn't change --- not fixed in v6 or v7-beta
  [?] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6199 (dateClick)
    V6 repro: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/OJKMLRR?editors=0010
    V7 has no real improvement
  "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
  hit-system: only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  this.detachInnerHeight() // should fire a 'null' height? yes! will cleanup any map listeners
Locales
  audit all allDayText. there's no more max-width in the CSS. use allDayHtml with breaks if needed
Dist
  ensure outputted CSS doesn't have multiple :root declarations because of how we shifted vars.css around
Manual Testing
  Touch devices
Dev Cleanup
  Remove unused css mixins
Changelog
  Add: all cell headers are no longer bold
  Add: standin events get put through eventContent/etc
Support Tickets
  Fixed this issue of mousedown taking long time to recalculate style?
    https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9078
    Can see forced-reflow warning here too: bundle/examples-v7/issue-7677.html

ensure automated tests for...
  positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
  resource-timeline indent works
  pixel # for height/contentHeight works
  correct header row heights for multi-header resource-TIMEgrid row with horizontal scrolling
  when nowIndicator is OFF, doesn't render in DOM at all
  percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
  that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views
