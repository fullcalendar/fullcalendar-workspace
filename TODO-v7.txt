General Markup
  better markup for Popover title/close (no span, use flexbox)
  put fc-border on viewcontainer
  z-index util classNames
General Performance
  why does TimelineLane::render get called 3 times initially?
  [ ] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/3003
    not rerendinering events that didn't change --- not fixed in v6 or v7-beta
  [?] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6199 (dateClick)
    V6 repro: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/OJKMLRR?editors=0010
    V7 has no real improvement
  "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
  hit-system: only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  this.detachInnerHeight() // should fire a 'null' height? yes! will cleanup any map listeners
General Code Cleanup
  Try to strip out dom-geom.ts and scrollbar-width, tho used for auto-scrolling
  remove the Preact createContext hack because this is now implemented:
    https://github.com/preactjs/preact/issues/2510
  Calendar::updateSize should call resize-observer force-check
    Don't do async Promise idea anymore
    Call flushSync after
  Kill memoizeArraylike,memoizeHashlike,others
General [manual-test]
  Touch devices
  been having issues with scrollwheel getting scrollsyncing out of whack!?
DayGrid
  why doesn't daygrid weeknumber have rounded corner anymore?
  weekNumbers in daygrid should be in DOM-order before cells
  simplify event positioning
    normalize each event-container's top by applying margin-top on ones that have smaller headers
    position each event-harness with a margin-top (in combo with existing abs positioning)
    after this^, we'll know the explicit min-height a row should be
      TODO: use this to explicitly set min-height on row div, this will override the not-smart
      "default" that the browser decides. then, force min-height:0 for all flex items (same with min-width),
      to be more like react-native, and more intuitive
MultiMonth
  Adjust multiMonthMinWidth since padding change
  Improve perf while switching years
  For print, force +morelink to isCompact=true
    Starting out NOT compact in forced 2-col formation, but when gets squished to where isCompact
    is needed, but ResizeObserver/etc doesn't adapt. examples-v7/multimonth-view.html
TimeGrid
  when setting slotDuration:{hours:1}, really short body. always like this? slats had bigger min-height?
  timegrid axis cell was reintroduced to avoid margin-left/right. text still selectable? audit z-indexes
Timeline
  previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap
    for real? matters? add to changelog?
  when height:auto, and empty events, body is 0 height. always like this?
Resource DayGrid
  on DayGridHeader (for TimeGrid too), dates-BELOW-resources don't have resource ID, did they ever?
    did their customer-render-func ever get passed a resource?
Resource Timeline
  [bug] when height:auto, infinite height increase
  when no groupcols, do simplified DOM structure?
  i flipped the natural DOM order of slats and resource-lanes.. has any bad effects?
    TODO: do same concept for timeline-no-resources
  when there's a superheader, and 2 headers in timeline area, padding in headers looks too thick?
  For resource-timeline "lanes", resource-group-rows have fc-resource-group but resource-rows
    do no have fc-resource. Make consistent? add to changelog?
H-Scrolling Views
  ensure col-width-syncing doesn't have 1px-off problem
    queries inner-width, but when assigning to outer-width, does it add 1px?
List
  rethink how listview has data-date on which element
Locales
  audit all allDayText. there's no more max-width in the CSS. use allDayHtml with breaks if needed
Examples
  In each two-column layout, give the sidebar flex-shrink:0 and the main min-width:0
    Things are currently collapsing very strangely on a narrow screen (like stackblitz angular demo)

Release Prep
------------

ensure outputted CSS doesn't have multiple :root declarations because of how we shifted vars.css around
revert "hacks to get print-mode working, but some should be reverted"
revert temporary gitignores

Automated Test TODO
-------------------

how an event can render as a/div/div[role=button]
weird list-view slicing logic we removed
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/9a0edaeb5eddf2cec8bd2409ecc26c4598b98a48/packages/list/src/ListView.tsx#L235-L249
resource-timeline rowgrouping
  has correct borders on bottom of rows, even when all row groups collapsed
  when expandRows: true, groups do not expand, only resources!
timeline/hscroll-timeGRID, when sticky-header
  ensure time-axis or resource area has bottom filler to match horizontal scrollbar
resource-timeline group cells (that run vertically) have correct border, especially 2nd and 3rd down
positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
resource-timeline indent works
pixel # for height/contentHeight works
correct header row heights for multi-header resource-TIMEgrid row with horizontal scrolling
when nowIndicator is OFF, doesn't render in DOM at all
percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views
test datagrid with h scroll, but timeline area WITHOUT h scroll
multiple tiers of headers line-up across scrollers
  timegrid h-scroll. with and without weekNumber
  resource-timeline. w/ datagrid/timeline headers: 1/2, 2/1
disabled days
  do NOT render navlinks (header or obviously day number)
  the headers WILL render data-date, fc-day-disabled (but not dayofweek, past, future classNames)
audit all past a11y bugs that aren't picked up by audit tool
  such as https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7566
  "The div and span elements have an implicit role of generic and cannot be named unless they have a role attribute."
aria-current='date' on today
no empty header cells

[fixed v7] DayGrid with height:auto "shows ResizeObserver loop warning"
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7861

Freshdesk/GH-issues
-------------------

Fixed this issue of mousedown taking long time to recalculate style?
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9078
  Can see forced-reflow warning here too: bundle/examples-v7/issue-7677.html
Make tickets for a new view with list-view underneath month calendar
Check ticket for daygrid view with "dots"
Need to split this issue
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/1037
  1. scrollreset (already implemented)
  2. scroll to current date or time
when infinite scroll-loading done
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9668
when virtual rendering done
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/8496
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9701
make ticket where +more popover is responsive? (takes up whole phone screen)
file bug for strange dragging events from timeline more-link (preexists)
timeline event dragging loses duration:
  1. have +more link with eventMaxStack
  2. open link, begin to drag event
  3. event looses it's duration. inconsistent with how normal event dragging happens
  (will be breaking change? maybe file ticket and add changelog)
  PREEXISTS: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/jOgeGwm?editors=0010
file preexisting v6 bug:
  non-singular view duration unit has weird hints on buttons "This ", "Next ", "Previous "
  https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/yyBpopg?editors=0010
TimeGrid
  Known visual regression with event positioning
    After implementing restored v4 timegrid event spacing (https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6569),
    Events squish too much:
      v4: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/pvzLNKr?editors=001 (BAD)
      v5: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/YPKapao?editors=0010 (GOOD)
      v6: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/NPKYbYb?editors=0010 (GOOD)
      v7: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/wBwJmgg?editors=001 (BAD)

Punt
----

General Markup
  kill fc-header-cell classname?
  in future css className refactor:
    fc-dayGridMonth -> fc-daygridmonth (to match fc-daygrid)
    fc-dayGridMonth-button -> fc-daygridmonth-button
    fc-timeline-now-indicator-arrow -> fc-timeline-nowindicator-arrow
    fc-timeline-more-link -> fc-timeline-morelink
    NEVERMIND. we've developed a strong precedent of dash-breaking-words,
      like week-number/day-number which needs to be both subcomponent (fc-daygrid-day>fc-daygrid-day-number)
      and independent component (fc-daygrid-week-number)
  Drop-shadow under sticky header, timeline headers
General Responsive
  Hide event times (daygrid/timeline) if too small?
  should fc-padding-* classes be responsive, meaning related to font-size?
    for fc-daygrid-day-number/fc-daygrid-week-number too
General Performance
  use css translateX/Y instead of top/left to prevent reflows
  user IntersectionObserver for DnD?
General a11y
  have separate settings for date-format hints? out of whack
    view's aria-label (if no headerToolbar) is "Sep 7 – 8, 2020" (bad that it's abbreviated)
    week-view's column headers have hint "September 7, 2020" which don't include day of week (like real text "Mon 9/7")
  change <button> to role=button for fewer css reset collision?
  "Note: The aria-rowindex must be added to each row, but is optional on the cells, except for cells that span rows: the aria-rowindex attribute is required on all spanning cells."
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-rowindex
DayGrid
  prevent DayGridCell headers from overflowing? makes really small calendars look better
Resource Timeline
  get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible.
    see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
Angular
  Building example project gives warnings like
    Ignoring this import because ".." was marked as having no side effects
TimeGrid
  when date-selecting with mirror event, why are we rendering highlight?
  for timeline event-dnd, the mirror, should have white glow just like timegrid for when overlap other events
    https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/jOgeGwm?editors=0010
Timeline
  for timeline event-dnd, the mirror, should have white glow just like timegrid for when overlap other events
MultiMonth
  put navlink on multimonth month header text?
Cross-browser
  Firefox
    [bug][regression]: after print-view (for timegrid as least) scroll gutter filler permanently disappears
      does not happen when rigging up "P" keystroke
    Re-address borderBoxSize HACK
    resource-timeline header borders a little messed up
  Safari
    [bug] shows ResizeObserver loop warning
      when moving from resourceTimelineDay -> resourceTimelineThreeDays
        when timeline header gains a level and gets taller
        probably related to totalBodyOuterHeight hackiness
  Chrome
    [bug] with timeline sticky multi-tier date text
      premium/bundle/examples/timeline-sticky-header.html
      1. Click 3-day view
      2. Resize resource area
      3. "Sat 1/7" flickers and changes position

Notes
-----

flexbox row expansion works across scroll regions: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/rNXdrLm?editors=1100
100% width within scroller applies to clientWidth only: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/GgKWRNZ?editors=1100
Print
  if you hit the debugging 'p' to force print-mode too soon after you stop scrolling,
    scrollEnd won't have enough time to fire and scroll state likely won't be saved,
    resulting in jump when entering print-mode. however, this isn't a realistic scenario because
    usually users have a long time between when they stop scrolling and when they initiate printing
  translateX/Y doesn't work when sticky items inside
  siblings must all be absolutely positioned if they are supposed to overlap
    and if you want them to span to subsequent pages in-sync
  Firefox:
    sometimes you just need to restart Firefox and things start working :(
    setting a bottom coordinate will NEVER wrap to subsequent pages
      problems with height:100% as well. hardcoded height needed
    weird issue: if abs positioned element starts on 2nd page and spans to third,
      makes a strange gap on 3rd page and pushes all content afterwards down
    if there's any sort of overflow:hidden/scroll container,
      screws up absolute positioning within, when spanning to subsequent pages. must disable
    JUST GIVE UP on multi-page absolutely positioned items in firefox
  bugzilla flexbox issues
    master ticket (pending): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=939897
    special-case fix (done): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=939897
      supposedly milestone 78.0a1
  bug with flexbox AND absolute positioning wrapping to subsequent pages (our discovery)
    ("Dinner" isn't showing up; starts on second page)
    (NEED TO LOOK AT ACTUAL PDF - differs from print preview sometimes)
      Firefox 120 - perfect
      Firefox 110 - good (event y off by 1px)
      Firefox 100 - good (event y off by 1px)
      Firefox 97 - good (event y off by 1px) --- February 8, 2022
      Firefox 96 - bad
      Firefox 95 - bad
      Firefox 90 - bad
  known-bugs:
    On Safari, table headers are not repeated for any view (browser bug)
a11y tree considerations
  aria-controls on resource-timeline parent-toggler
    is difficult because a parent row could control MANY child rows, and we don't have wrappers for
    those children, so aria-controls would need to be a huge dynamic list of tokens
  additional aria
    aria-level (depth)
    aria-posinset (index in current set)
    aria-setsize (current set size, not child size)
    ***I wanted to do this, but if rows out of order (because of virtualization),
      then no way to establish parent/child relationships
Why we need to use a <Ruler> to measure dimensions
  ResizeObserver does NOT synchronously handle dimension changes to self or ancestors while
  handling current element's dimensions. Will give a "ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications"
  error. Quintessential example is implementing an aspect-ratio element, which sets height of self after reading
  width of self. <Ruler> detangles dimension relationships and is very portable.

How to do liquid-width/height, multiple technique
  Classic performant technique (currently used):
    FIXED-AREAS: nothing
    LIQUID-AREAS: { flex-grow:1, min-height:0, flex-basis:0 }
    Needed for horizontal equal-width cell expansion; basis0 is important
  Experimental:
    FIXED-AREAS: { flex-shrink:0 }
    LIQUID-AREAS: { flex-grow:1, min-height:0 }
    Good for layouts that are conditionally liquid-height
    Tho probably not as performant because need to compute the pre-squished AND post-squished layouts
