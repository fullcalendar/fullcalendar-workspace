Finish timegrid narrowness
  TimeGrid BG-events should get isShort
    search for isShort: false,
  AFTER
    audit col-events AND columnMoreLinkInnerClass
maybe data.hasMonthLabel could be killed
  and just have data.monthText... and might be empty!
  (only if we decide to kill type of api for this format... not "fallback")
fix Monarch timegrid horizontal scroll


MANUAL TEST
  test background event title size, in daygrid too (monitor isCompact)
  test timeline/timegrid more-link in DARK mode
  now-indicator
  ALL stickiness, esp when calendar root is overflow:hidden
  test horizontal scrolling
  test growRows
  more-link in timegrid and timeline
  vresource view
  multi-month stack looks good
  multi-month day with 1-event should show event, not +1more link
  check touch-selecting and dragging/resizing effects
  check print-view
  test prevYear/nextYear icons in all theme systems
  core: test sticky footer scrollbar on timegrid-pannable/normal, daygrid-pannable/normal
  ensure larger dayCellFormat formats work w/ dayCellInner circles
  For block-events that display, there should be a visual distinctions between time/title text
    test with eventDisplay='block'
  DONE, but save for checklist
    When "today" is first of month, how long-text render in today-circle
CODE-QUALITY (while going through each theme)
  all hover-pressables have focus-visible:
  put text color on every text node? no inheritance?
  ensure joinClassNames() isn't used for top-level props. isn't needed (accepts array)
  ensure no unnecessary `` instead ''
  stop concatenating with param classnames. sometimes they're blank
    like `border ${params.borderColorClass}`. many others too
    have AI correct it
  make all theme util functions that emit classnames return STRING (and thus call joinClassNames)?
  slotLabel(Inner)Class and slotLabelDividerClass
    should almost always be in the timegrid/timeline sections of the theme
  OUTLINE: props that should be given .(primary|tertiary)OutlineColorClass / .outlineWidthFocusClass:
    eventClass (include outlineWidthClass instead if .isSelected)
    blockEventClass (if you're using primaryOutlineColorClass, apply .outlineOffsetWidth)
    moreLinkClass
    navLinkClass
    popoverCloseClass
    resourceExpanderClass
    if using slots.tsx,
      apply .outlineWidthGroupFocusClass to sub-elements
    dayHeaderInnerClass does NOT need it! already has nav-link. but might need "offset" class
NOTES
  an *OulineFocusClass only goes on the *Button, NOT the *Pressable
  for alignment,
    dayHeader, resourceAreaHeader, and timeline-slotLabel are flex-col
    timeGrid-slotLabel is flex-row
  text size:
    text-sm = 14px (day-numbers, slot-labels, datagrid cells)
    text-xs = 12px (events)
    xxsTextClass ~= 11px (time within events -- use sparingly)
  rowMoreLinkInner class is necessary for stickiness in timeline
  we have CORE handle as much stickiness as possible because
    REACT-NATIVE (when we eventually target it) cannot do stickiness,
    we need a higher-level JSX util of sorts
  slotLabelAlign/slotLabelSticky not supported in timegrid,
    so only put settings in timeline
  "dark:" not allowed in theme core! no way to detect without relying on third-party UI lib
  we actually like moreLinkerInnerClass, because the "inner" is for stickiness
    and the outer is for background color. just like stickiness in datagrid
    however, for 'gap-*', but in ui-system-specific files (because not used in most UI-specific)
  for event-like element inner-padding,
    it's tempting to put all padding on title/time, but the wrapper elements needs 1px
    because for print-view, it uses transparent border
  for icons within buttons,
    we wanted to put negative margin on the icon and keep the button padding constant regardless
    of whether only-icon or not (in hopes that icon+text would work) but turns out negative margins
    on icon causes icon to overlap text within same button. Best just to continue using isIconOnly
  to do a two-col with first-col min-width percentage, up to a pixel max width, and second column liquid, do:
    1st col - shrink-0 w-1/4 max-w-40
    2nd col - grow max-w-0
  for popover dayHeader,
    we decided NOT to bake popoverClose into the dayHeader because
    1. having the popoverClose as a child of a flex-row (which is different than how dayHeader normally
       does) causes the way you do vertical alignment to change depending on context (items-center VS justify-center)
    2. easier to have dayHeader as its own isolated component
    CONCLUSION: make the X absolutely positioned over it


just before beta (after theme gen)
----------------
Updating ANGULAR will take a long time
App.tsx:
  write js-only App demo (with js plugins)
  write mui-only App demo
  have font-families change based on Component Lib
  BUG?: z-index of subcomponents go above the topbar?
Ensure .gitignore for theme packages is correct
when themes have a strong default preference, encode it into the theme!
  (like for Monarch, listDayFormat: { day: 'numeric' })

project: ResizeObserver refactor
  ResourceTimeline height:auto
    premium/bundle/a11y-ci/resource-timeline-flat-height-auto.html
    Not exactly sure why fixed-scrollbar would cause this
    Comment-out all Scroller vertical watching,
      then toggle time-area footer fixed-scrollbar. toggles problem
  ResourceTimeline switching resourceTimelineDay -> resourceTimelineThreeDays
    premium/bundle/a11y-ci/resource-timeline-flat-height.html
    Happening when timeline-header height increases,
      needs to change height of data-grid header, thus data-grid body

    bug: bottom filler isn't working in a11y-ci/resource-timeline-row-grouping.html


AFTER BETA
----------

Update latest shadcn theme colors (newest version of shadcn updated them)
move away from okhlc colors... bad browser support
print-view is messed up
think about reviving compact timegrid print view, or at least providing a setting
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/11181
  We already keep this code for buggy firefox
delete classic-theme and bootstrap5 packages
bug: why when resourceGroupHeaderClass bg color removed, we don't see vertical column lines underneath?
bugs with isMajor special border on slots
  doesn't work on resourceTimelineThreeDays/Week/Month (am I not configuring correctly)
  darker border is incorrectly on some vresource header cells
classic-theme: buttons in dark-mode should have colors inverted: selected should be lighter than non-selected
[rename] CustomContentGenerator -> ContentGenerator (and customGenerator)
[rename?] is EventDisplayData the best name when there's interaction-like props like isSelected?
accept objects for *Class inputs
rename listDaySideFormat -> listDayAltFormat ?
  (because theme might not decide to put it on the "side")
  maybe not "alt" because ppl might think related to alt-text
  TODO: give isAlt/isSide as a prop to the classname-generator
ensure isMajor on resourceDayHeaders... this matters!
  depends on resource-above-dates or opposites
  HAVE THEMES leverage this. darker line
ensure no-margin, no-padding on certain elements
  ensure not used when not supposed to!
update manual theme tests for `icons` removal
  search for `icons: {`
weird how expander is valigned differently than resource-area header/cell content
audit all justify/align in theme. ensure axis is intuitive
DRY up function utils in MorePopover
rename isHeader -> inHeader (or just do "is" for everything)
make a "cn" public utility
dont allow margins on dayHeaderInnerClass or any class really!
should vresource headers be sticky! yes! not the case in resourceTimeGridWeek
  for both cases of datesAboveHeaders
  maybe even do centering trick we do for slot labels!?
nice way of doing shadow when scroll-down?
i don't like how we need to do transparent border for non-divider when isHeader
  solution: put it IN the scroller (sibling of the canvas),
  also, this way we can do a nowIndicator DOT above it within the scroller
bug: when datesAboveResources, and multiple resources per-day,
  the day text is overabbreviates as "Thu" when it still has a lot of room
bug:
  bug: resourceTimelineDay totally misalligned (with 3 resources)
bug: when displayEventTime:false,
  list-item events with "All-day" remain (always like this?)
bug: for default titleFormat in week view
  why are we getting "Jan 2023 – Feb 2023"? Problem with our ponyfill?
bug: why targeting single-day view doesnt work?
  views: { day: { dayHeaderFormat: { day: 'numeric', weekday: 'long' } } }
  ^^works but only for some settings
bug: in Chrome and Safari, scroll-syncing really getting out of alignment
  stickyHeaderDates might cause it. test it a lot
bug: resource-timeline doing multiple group columns. positioning broken (bundle/a11y-ci/resource-timeline-col-grouping.html)
  will require refactor of how resource-timeline "entities" IDs are created: createEntityId / getEntityKey
  automated-test: two nested group, across different parents, with same group value
bug: resource-timeline print-view with multiple columns; broken positioning
bug: eventColor not working in resource-timeline-row-grouping.html
bug: we are incorrectly allowing stickyFooterScrollbar when height is not auto,
  which results in no visible vertical scrollbars (at least in resourceTimeGridWeek)
bug: Causes scrollbars when there shouldn't be
  slotDuration: '01:00',
  expandRows: true,
Currently, in v6, the headerToolbar left/center/right properties MERGE, which is a bit crazy
  Overhaul the default setting
  Add to changelog
new Angular version
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7946#issuecomment-3019245564
[rename] maybe rename "canvas" color to "background" color?
  NOTES: rename --fc-*-canvas-color... because in pulse theme, outer background could be gray,
    but we still want popover bg to be white. call is just "bg" color?
[rename] fillerClass.inHeader -> withinHeader ?
our global.css.js technique allows multiple attachments to same parent!? bad
  can we somehow lazily attach? or is that bad for performance...
    maybe so, but mainly used for shadow-dom people. real-dom people CAN use it,
    but should be encouraged to use global.css instead
For first-slot label that's negative, accept new data-prop that signls no rendering label
  For themes with this, have them default the first-slot to 11pm the night before?
when no dayHeaderDividerClass, should not inject <div>
Address HACK in code, search: "HACK when clientWidth does NOT include body-border, compared to totalWidth"
  ^^^more problems with this in TimeGrid, lines not aligning!
obvious API win, unrelated to V7:
  an events function should be able to return a non-promise,
  aka an events array.
api: better way to ensure min slot width/height. right now we depend on theme!?
ensure nowIndicator doesn't appear in print view
[dist] No more CJS!
[dist] Support module-sync in package.json
[rename] instead of "in*" names which could be confused with "is*" names, do something like this:
  insideViewGroup
  insidePopover
  within?
[a11y] if third-party ui-libraries define their own tabs, ensure aria is correctly wired up somehow
[forward-port] we made event rerender optimization in v6 where DnD of event results in only 1 eventContent call
  v7 still does 2 (or more?)... understandable because needs to clone event for mirror DnD?
  write tests even tho didn't write for v6
does Safari seem really slow?
easy performance win for multi-month? css reflows?
[rename] all sticky settings to *Sticky
more granular sticky settings?
  tableHeaderSticky
  rowEventTitleSticky
  colEventTitleSticky
  slotLabelInnerSticky
next theme platforms to implement:
  Vuetify
  Angular Material
Move away from Node16 module-importing with ".js"
THEME SYSTEM
  think about how classname overriding should work
    in new gen FullCalendar react component, when specified in option, overrides what <FullCalendar> wants
      a feature not a bug
    should we emulate this in JS api too?
      only have classname merging happen between calendar+viewoptions?
  we killed the default headerToolbar. bad idea?
    was ever merged recursively? if so, dont do that
  [rename] stickyHeaderDates -> tableHeaderSticky
    we already have tableHeaderSticky in the codebase, but its a CLASSNAME, not a flag
    (write in changelog that doesn't apply to list-view day-headers anymore)
  [new-setting] slotLabelInnerSticky (boolean)
  [rename] stickyFooterScrollbar -> footerScrollbarSticky
  [eventually, when we need the feature]
    headerToolbarSticky
    footerScrollbarSticky
  [eventually]
    weekNumberDisplay: 'inline' | 'column'
    weekNumberHeaderClass: ({ hasNavLink, date? }) --- similar to dayHeaderClass which has a fake date
    weekNumberCellClass: ({ hasNavLink, date })
    (even tho dissonant with inlineWeekNumberClass)
  Implement (Content/DidMount/WillUnmount on all)
    (hard because generatorName="" requires a string)
    blockEventContent
    rowEventContent
    columnEventContent
    listItemEventContent
Probably kill Bootstrap support, or add it back in after v7 release
  Should be a UI system just like Shadcn or MUI
  Keep using glyphicons? Probably yes, because SVG icons not distributed as JSX (like Lucide or MUI icons)
[rename] dayPopoverFormat -> popoverFormat?
  because popoverFormat+popoverClass AND dayHeaderFormat+dayHeaderClass AND dayCellFormat+dayCellClass
clean package.jsons
  ensure license specified in all
more popoverClose to direct sibling of popover
  will allow DayHeader to be own component in future
print:
  better background-events in print-view. add border?
  print problems with App.tsx (look at timeline)
  text print-mode when originating from dark-mode
  look out for "sticky" tailwind classes in themes. causing problems for print?
  how to handle print-view for our default-ui UI controls?
    example: pulse buttons have weird background
put div wrapper around columnMoreLink, just like abs events (TimeGrid)
  we don't like how it already has position:absolute, which could be confusing for theme authors
bug: in a week view, open a more-popover, click dayheader to follow the navlink,
  the view changes but the popover stays!
docs: your own responsive behavior for toolbars
  we can't make one-size fits all, because start/center/right configured by dev
bug: now-indicator, in resourceTimeGridDay, when today, in modern themes,
  Multiple dots are displayed (see screenshot)
bug: in resource-timeline, when 2 rows of datagrid headers & 2 rows of slotLabels,
  the header-rows heights' should sync with eachother
  but I believe I ripped this out and let flexbox-growing take-over
  TODO: restore header-row height syncing across panes
think about browser support. just require logical properties? (2021)
  https://caniuse.com/css-logical-props
  resizeobserver could be fully relied on!
  can use aspectRatio too!!!???
    https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_aspect-ratio
  color mix:
    https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_color-mix
ensure selected event as hight z-index than others
  important when selected event as outline that should go over others
rename?: the "before" and "after" content to start/end?
  rowEventStartContent
  rowEventEndContent
  works with isEndResizable
hide now-indicator when in print
print-view, hide buttons, or at least make sure they don't look terrible?
just like we allowed margin on dayHeaderInner (which is a navlink),
  allow margin on slotLabelInner
  subsequently, audit align-self everywhere? because wrappers changed
add weekdayText wherever we add dayNumberText
core?: when timegrid overlapping events, focused event should be top z-index
core?: control z-index of selected button in button group. always want above others
timegrid more-link is in strange DOM order, leading to bad tab-index
kill all hover:no-underline in themes?
  the developer's responsiblity to prevent overly opinionated inheritance
  (add to docs?)
  FYI, they might be adding underline to a[href] or just all `a`
Never have themes define z-index
  example: for event-before/after, ensure z-1
For portal roots, give border-box and other resets?... IMPORTANT!
--fc-monarch-foreground is used for color mixing, but use it for text color too?
Maybe don't do fallback for dayNumberText or weekdayText...
  if it's not present, then that means the *format* didn't want to display it?
  if so, we can do !data.dayNumberText to pre-detect that current-day won't display circle
When color-mix used, ensure fallback for older browsers
Instead of opacity to control icon colors, use muted/disabledFgColorClass?
Instead of opacity for backgroundEventTitleClass, muted/disabledFgColorClass?
What controls slot min-width in timeline when slotLabelInterval is large? seems to be 30px
  (see resourceTimelineWeek in App)
[rename] colCount -> monthColCount (otherwise might think days)
rethink listDayFormat/listDaySideFormat
  they get flipped for listDay <> listWeek
  one part should probably be day-of-week
  other part should probably be fuller date decided by view duration

Docs
----

make note in component anatomy that disabled slots/daycells/daylanes need to be specifically handled
we will not be implementing "easier way to inject default eventContent"
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5927
  I was hoping to use eventElement to affect outer rendering, but complications about any new
  provided top-level event div not having correct aria-roles and flex-css.
  In reality, tooltip libs like these..
  - https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tooltip/
  - https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/tooltip
  ..don't create a wrapper div, they just somehow mark the provided top level element(s) with
  handlers and aria attributes, and the revealed tooltip is rooted somewhere else in the DOM.
  So, an inner-wrapper is okay, assuming dev is okay not having tooltip on outer 1px border
  (or they can inject a flex-grow wrapper)
  SOLUTION to accessing default content:
  Tell people they can just recreate the very simple markup from StandardEvent's renderInnerContent
    (remind them background events have different markup. simpler. converge them?)
previous docs said button.click would receive second argument as HTMLElement, but doesn't seem so
update examples in web-component README
talk about updateSize doesn't needed because of ResizeObserver
recommendation to CSS authors:
  don't use nesting
Rename all "arg"-like parameters in the docs:
  Info:
  Content:

  Arg)
Getting VSCode TailwindCSS Intellisense working with FullCalendar's theming classNames:
  "tailwindCSS.classAttributes": [
    ".*Class"
  ]
Background events don't respect contrast color
  because the color is made transparent, it's essentially considered the canvas color
  but themes can override by forcing text-color for backgroundEventTitleClass


Release Prep
------------

New linting system
Ensure `private` on all private class members
Ensure built types don't leak internal structures
Tame all scratch example files
Remove outdated .changeset transactions
Ensure outputted CSS doesn't have multiple :root declarations because of how we shifted vars.css around
Revert "hacks to get print-mode working, but some should be reverted"
Revert temporary gitignores
Audit all dependency workspace: protocols
complete package.json for classic-theme
Create aXe scrollbar workaround
Rerun aXe tests
hire designer for schematics
somehow publish classic tailwind theme?
adjust transpilation settings. es2016 okay now, with null coalescing operator?
ensure all new settings are put on the Angular connector!
test print-view extensively after theme refactor
test all horizontally-scrolling views
test z-index of events and more-link ABOVE background events in ALL VIEWs
temp files to eventually kill:
  TODO-v7.txt
  standard/CHANGELOG-v7.txt
  standard/MIGRATION-CUSTOM-CSS.md


After Launch
------------

importmap.public.html needs to be updated. accesses published files


Automated Test TODO
-------------------

automated-tests: do "isMajor/isMinor API additions"
how an event can render as a/div/div[role=button]
weird list-view slicing logic we removed
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/9a0edaeb5eddf2cec8bd2409ecc26c4598b98a48/packages/list/src/ListView.tsx#L235-L249
resource-timeline rowgrouping
  has correct borders on bottom of rows, even when all row groups collapsed
  when expandRows: true, groups do not expand, only resources!
timeline/hscroll-timeGRID, when sticky-header
  ensure time-axis or resource area has bottom filler to match horizontal scrollbar
resource-timeline group cells (that run vertically) have correct border, especially 2nd and 3rd down
positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
resource-timeline indent works
pixel # for height/contentHeight works
correct header row heights for multi-header resource-TIMEgrid row with horizontal scrolling
when nowIndicator is OFF, doesn't render in DOM at all
percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views
test datagrid with h scroll, but timeline area WITHOUT h scroll
multiple tiers of headers line-up across scrollers
  timegrid h-scroll. with and without weekNumber
  resource-timeline. w/ datagrid/timeline headers: 1/2, 2/1
disabled days
  do NOT render navlinks (header or obviously day number)

Freshdesk/GH-issues
-------------------

confusion over event color and text-color:
  list-item unintuitive (not really addressed):
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6966
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7694
  background events (can add to theme bg events via text-(--fc-event-contrast-color)):
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5528
Fixed this issue of mousedown taking long time to recalculate style?
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9078
  Can see forced-reflow warning here too: bundle/examples-v7/issue-7677.html
Make tickets for a new view with list-view underneath month calendar
Check ticket for daygrid view with "dots"
Need to split this issue
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/1037
  1. scrollreset (already implemented)
  2. scroll to current date or time

when virtual rendering done
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/8496
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9701
make ticket where +more popover is responsive? (takes up whole phone screen)
file bug for strange dragging events from timeline more-link (preexists)
timeline event dragging loses duration:
  1. have +more link with eventMaxStack
  2. open link, begin to drag event
  3. event looses it's duration. inconsistent with how normal event dragging happens
  (will be breaking change? maybe file ticket and add changelog)
  PREEXISTS: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/jOgeGwm?editors=0010
file preexisting v6 bug:
  non-singular view duration unit has weird hints on buttons "This ", "Next ", "Previous "

TimeGrid
  Known visual regression with event positioning
    After implementing restored v4 timegrid event spacing (https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6569),
    Events squish too much:
      v4: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/pvzLNKr?editors=001 (BAD)

responsive tickets (so ppl know we don't consider responsiveness "solved"):
  tiled multimonth view, JUST have event dots, nothing else
  timegrid week view, but with ONLY one day column. has multiple day headers for selecting other days tho
Create GH ticket for reviving weekNumber column (weekNumberDisplay: 'column')
Make ticket: multiple levels of dayheaders (not related to resources)
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/11101

General Markup
  in future css className refactor:
    fc-dayGridMonth -> fc-daygridmonth (to match fc-daygrid)
    fc-dayGridMonth-button -> fc-daygridmonth-button
    fc-timeline-now-indicator-arrow -> fc-timeline-nowindicator-arrow
    fc-timeline-more-link -> fc-timeline-morelink
    NEVERMIND. we've developed a strong precedent of dash-breaking-words,
      like week-number/day-number which needs to be both subcomponent (fc-daygrid-day>fc-daygrid-day-number)
      and independent component (fc-daygrid-week-number)
  Drop-shadow under sticky header, timeline headers
General Responsive
  Hide event times (daygrid/timeline) if too small?
  should fc-padding-* classes be responsive, meaning related to font-size?
    for fc-daygrid-day-number/fc-daygrid-week-number too
General Performance
  use css translateX/Y instead of top/left to prevent reflows
  user IntersectionObserver for DnD?
  when there's no ref watching a dimension, don't attach resize observer to element
    example: simple Month-view always listens to header heights (innerHeightRef) because TimeGrid
    needs to sync height with all-day cell
  TEST AFTER RELEASE - dayClick slow
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6199 (dateClick)
    V6 repro: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/OJKMLRR?editors=0010
    V7 has no real improvement
General a11y
  Week numbers should be tabbable
  have separate settings for date-format hints? out of whack
    view's aria-label (if no headerToolbar) is "Sep 7 – 8, 2020" (bad that it's abbreviated)
    week-view's column headers have hint "September 7, 2020" which don't include day of week (like real text "Mon 9/7")
  change <button> to role=button for fewer css reset collision?
  "Note: The aria-rowindex must be added to each row, but is optional on the cells, except for cells that span rows: the aria-rowindex attribute is required on all spanning cells."
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-rowindex
DayGrid
  prevent DayGridCell headers from overflowing? makes really small calendars look better
  [structure] simplify event positioning
    normalize each event-container's top by applying margin-top on ones that have smaller headers
    position each event-harness with a margin-top (in combo with existing abs positioning)
    after this^, we'll know the explicit min-height a row should be
      TODO: use this to explicitly set min-height on row div, this will override the not-smart
      "default" that the browser decides. then, force min-height:0 for all flex items (same with min-width),
      to be more like react-native, and more intuitive
Resource Timeline
  [structure] when no groupcols, do simplified DOM structure?
  get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible.
    see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
Angular
  Building example project gives warnings like
    Ignoring this import because ".." was marked as having no side effects
TimeGrid
  when date-selecting with mirror event, why are we rendering highlight?
  for timeline event-dnd, the mirror, should have white glow just like timegrid for when overlap other events
    https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/jOgeGwm?editors=0010
Timeline
  for timeline event-dnd, the mirror, should have white glow just like timegrid for when overlap other events
MultiMonth
  put navlink on multimonth month header text?
  For print, force +morelink to isCompact=true
    Starting out NOT compact in forced 2-col formation, but when gets squished to where isCompact
    is needed, but ResizeObserver/etc doesn't adapt. examples-v7/multimonth-view.html
Cross-browser
  Firefox
    [bug][regression]: after print-view (for timegrid as least) scroll gutter filler permanently disappears
      does not happen when rigging up "P" keystroke
    Re-address borderBoxSize HACK
    resource-timeline header borders a little messed up
  Chrome
    [bug] with timeline sticky multi-tier date text
      premium/bundle/examples/timeline-sticky-header.html
      1. Click 3-day view
      2. Resize resource area
      3. "Sat 1/7" flickers and changes position
Example Projects
  In each two-column layout, give the sidebar flex-shrink:0 and the main min-width:0
    Things are currently collapsing very strangely on a narrow screen (like stackblitz angular demo)
punt: calendar-wide resourceColumnHeader* hooks should receive column definition
punt: audit all *Content hooks that accept `text` argument
  we like this pattern
  text is computed from translation or Intl
punt: bug: why does display:background not work on a 'Repeating Event'
  because it's a timed event. todo: document this better?
punt: decision: change direction -> dir everywhere?
punt: decision: buttons{}.click -> .handleClick ?
punt: kill all role=rowgroup ... a11y says it's optional. makes code confusing
punt: make setting where week number can be a column. how does this affect theming?
punt: [existing bug] eventMaxStack:1 is pretty dumb for two events:
  just displays the second event as a +more link, not saving space!!!
punt: timegrid all-day background events are displayed in both all-day and timed
  if there's a title, shows twice. doesn't look good
punt: create singleMonthTitleContent and give textParts to it?
punt: rename text->dateText and textParts->dateParts?
punt: workaround "dual-package hazard"? see the recommendation in temporal polyfill repo
punt: Should we still have data-date attributes on elements?
punt: don't use <Scroller> when not necessary
  ListView
  MultiMonth
punt: have theme define col-resizer (both for resource-area columns and whole area)
punt: our daygrid event-resizing get sloppier in some recent versions.
  previously, you'd drag over half-a-cell to trigger +1day. Now, it happens as soon as there's pixel overlap
punt: test dark mode that turns into print
punt: rename "mirror"?
punt: sticky list-view header, scrolldown accumulates double border
punt: way to put nonBusinessHours on Sun+Sat header (awkward to do with abs fill like dayLane)
punt(existing-quirk): when timegrid events are overlapping, and touch-dragging initiated on one,
  (aka "selecting" it), when at mouseup rest, event can still be underneath other events
  solution: make sure above all other events if selected
punt: daygrid cells' event h-positioning (uses percentage) conflicts with flexbox, doesn't quite match up
punt: move cell border to flex-end
  better for infinite horiztonal scroll later
  rows have it on bottom because better for print, breaking to second page
  ACTUALLY NOOO... the isMajor darker border depends on border at flex-start
punt: instead of position:relative/absolute an z-index:0,
  use isolation:isolate (well supported)
punt: in toolbars, remove left/right keys. force start/end keys (then add to changelog)
punt: sticky header in vertical resource view, horizontal scrolling. new feature
  do in CORE, not in theme. analagous to vertically-sticky resource cells
  if it were the theme, we'd need to pass a renderProp, and hard to know what the name would be
punt: slotMinHeight setting
eventually have MUI themes output styles using sx={} prop, like:
  https://chatgpt.com/share/688a7d49-4314-800f-b1c5-9253733352be
  we can eventually do optionParams like that too:
    const theme = useTheme()
    sx={{
      borderInlineStart: '1px solid',
      borderColor: theme.palette.error.main,
    }}
  can actually use design tokens directly as string;
    sx={{ color: 'text.secondary' }} // assumed to be palette i think
  dynamic value pitfall
    https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/#dynamic-values
  or use "callback values" to get the theme:
    https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/#callback-values
  on a div:
    unstable_styleFunctionSx somehow
    https://mui.com/system/getting-started/custom-components/#using-sx-with-custom-components
  what Chakra does:
    <Button
      borderStart="2px solid"
      borderColor={{ base: 'red.500', _dark: 'red.300' }}
    >
      Click Me
    </Button>
  how would this work??? (MUI or Chakra)
    would need to a markup-output target, like react-native
punt: API change: stop passing-in createElement to render funcs:
  typedef: `export type CustomContentGenerator<RenderProps> = CustomContent | ((renderProps: RenderProps, createElement: any) => (CustomContent | true))`
give the iconContent an isPrimary param
  in case user overrides prev/next buttons to isPrimary:true
make noEventsInnerClass sticky in all themes (not just classic)
  but its hard because there's rounded-corner containers with overflow:hidden
  solution is hard, which is make the rounded corners (and borders) part of the scroller
  hard for themes to control
  even harder when you consider MUI/Shadcn do the outer border with a separate div sometimes
Disallow explicit widths/heights on certain elements (bad for positioning)
  dayHeaderRowClass
  dayHeaderClass
  dayRowClass
  dayCellClass
  slotLabel
  slotLane
  allDayHeaderClass
  weekNumberHeaderClass
  (essentially anything with an "inner" inside)
unrelated feature: in multimonth, even when current year, "today" button should scroll to today

we really do care about minimizing ResizeObserver loops, prevents flicker. so, safari is valuable
flexbox row expansion works across scroll regions: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/rNXdrLm?editors=1100
100% width within scroller applies to clientWidth only: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/GgKWRNZ?editors=1100
Print
  if you hit the debugging 'p' to force print-mode too soon after you stop scrolling,
    scrollEnd won't have enough time to fire and scroll state likely won't be saved,
    resulting in jump when entering print-mode. however, this isn't a realistic scenario because
    usually users have a long time between when they stop scrolling and when they initiate printing
  translateX/Y doesn't work when sticky items inside
  siblings must all be absolutely positioned if they are supposed to overlap
    and if you want them to span to subsequent pages in-sync
  Firefox:
    sometimes you just need to restart Firefox and things start working :(
    setting a bottom coordinate will NEVER wrap to subsequent pages
      problems with height:100% as well. hardcoded height needed
    weird issue: if abs positioned element starts on 2nd page and spans to third,
      makes a strange gap on 3rd page and pushes all content afterwards down
    if there's any sort of overflow:hidden/scroll container,
      screws up absolute positioning within, when spanning to subsequent pages. must disable
    JUST GIVE UP on multi-page absolutely positioned items in firefox

  known-bugs:
    On Safari, table headers are not repeated for any view (browser bug)
a11y tree considerations
  aria-controls on resource-timeline parent-toggler
    is difficult because a parent row could control MANY child rows, and we don't have wrappers for
    those children, so aria-controls would need to be a huge dynamic list of tokens
  additional aria
    aria-level (depth)
    aria-posinset (index in current set)
    aria-setsize (current set size, not child size)
    ***I wanted to do this, but if rows out of order (because of virtualization),
      then no way to establish parent/child relationships
Why we need to use a <Ruler> to measure dimensions
  ResizeObserver does NOT synchronously handle dimension changes to self or ancestors while
  handling current element's dimensions. Will give a "ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications"
  error. Quintessential example is implementing an aspect-ratio element, which sets height of self after reading
  width of self. <Ruler> detangles dimension relationships and is very portable.

How to do liquid-width/height, multiple technique
  Classic performant technique (currently used):
    FIXED-AREAS: nothing
    LIQUID-AREAS: { flex-grow:1, min-height:0, flex-basis:0 }
    Needed for horizontal equal-width cell expansion; basis0 is important
  Experimental:
    FIXED-AREAS: { flex-shrink:0 }
    LIQUID-AREAS: { flex-grow:1, min-height:0 }
    Good for layouts that are conditionally liquid-height
    Tho probably not as performant because need to compute the pre-squished AND post-squished layouts
note: bg-fill / bg-event background event z-indexes
  when border-color appears adjacent to bg-fill, looks muddy. either make slats semi-transparent,
    or make bg-fills semi-transparent
  we CAN'T make the border semi-transparent, because would appear darker at vertices where slats
    and lanes overlap
  we SHOULDN'T put resource-timeline bg-fills below the slats, because would require two canvas
    during infinite scroll
  SO, bg-fill must be ABOVE borders, below fg-events and day numbers
  this is will be challenging for dayGrid in react-native,
    since react-native is simplified rules for z-index -- only DOM siblings can be stacking siblings
    the solution will be to have individual bg-fills per-cell, which we might sortof need to do
    for a11y anyway (and we can just visually hide the bg-event title on subsequent days)
  for timegrid, (and eventually daygrid if we move to above^^ technique),
    we need the bg-fill to overlap the cell/lane's border
    right now, in timegrid, we achieve this with negative margin
    however in future we need better solution
      CANNOT: make wrapper <div> and put cell + fills inside. because events live within the cell
      and will run into react-native-esque problems again!
      WE REALLY just need to do trial-and-error in react-native to see what's possible
Other ways to rearrange list-item-event DOT
  (Currently we're using display:contents with order:-1)
  (FYI, react-native doesn't allow allow (flex)order to be set)
  1. Simply override whole eventContent(), while incorporating timeClass/timeClass
  2. Use flex-direction: inverse-row to reverse time/title,
      and then absolutely position color dot with well-known left offset
RESEARCH on Angular slots
  https://chatgpt.com/share/6886ea31-81d8-800f-9abe-ac81e014c200
  There are two techniques for scoped slots.
  See "Can They Be Used Together?"... YES (what we're sortof doing already i think)
NOTE: another reason why good to have semitransparent bg events and business hours... they stack
  on top of eachother well
pattern for "apiRef": https://docs.svar.dev/react/gantt/api/methods/detach
How to manipulate MUI colors when there's no cssVariables enabled
  if matches var(--mui-*main)
    (theme) => `rgba(var(--mui-*mainChannel) / 0.1)`
  otherwise
    (theme) => alpha(muiTheme.palette.warning.main, 0.1)
    // or maybe just parse the color values like rgab(r, g, b, a) and change the a
We use linear-gradient trick to do alpha-compositing,
  and we need to specify BOTH args in linear-gradient.
  eventually we can save space and just pass one when browser suppor it:
  https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_gradient_linear-gradient_single_color_stop
For tab-focus effect,
  DO do background-color change on ghost buttons
  do NOT do background-color change (of any sort) on block-events (usually reduces contrast, looks bad)
why is core so opinionated about borders around singleMonthClass?
  (it will be very proactive about removing borders...
  ...make sense if you want all months to stack flush when single column,
  but what if you want space between months?)
  Answer: space-between the months would look BAD when there needs to be sticky month headers
  So, we don't want to allow it. Once we make this decision, we can help the user out about
  borders and killing borders strategically to prevent double-borders
weird API decision explained
  meant for shadows:
    dayHeaderDividerClass.isSticky
      true if right above timegrid scrolling OR if tableHeader is sticky
  where else is "isSticky" used?
    tableHeaderClass.isSticky -- could literally be sticky
    singleMonthHeaderClass.isSticky -- could literally be sticky
  what contains what divider?
    dayHeaderDivider is last-child of tableHeader
    allDayDivider is middle-child of tableBody
  what we really want
    allDayDivider will ALWAYS have a shadow
    dayHeaderDividerClass will KILL its shadow if there's an all-day slot
    We might need data.* props that reference more global scope
      allDaySlotPresent?    viewAllDaySlot
      businessHoursPresent? viewBusinessHours
  to make matters more complicated
    isSticky often controls whether bottom-border present or not
    for dayHeaderDividerClass, in Forma and Pulse themes
  solution:
    dayHeaderDividerClass.isSticky should always refer to whether the tableHeader is sticky!
    dayHeaderDividerClass.options.allDaySlot
      (will only ever be used on timeGrid settings)
    what about whant height:auto and BOTH table-header AND all-day slot are sticky?
      the "solution" works
      the prior solution of abusing isSticky would NOT work in this situation
        because the dayHeaderDividerClass would literally be sticky, but we don't want shadow
Who controls a popoverClose's styling?
  Ideally each theme-* would control the dimensions,
    because they it could more intelligently control its abs position
  However, MUI (and maybe future UI systems) have a preference for icon size
    because rasterization sometimes looks weird at certain sizes (grep "CloseIcon")
  So, let each ui-* system control it,
    BUT STIPULATE THAT IT MUST end up at 20px x 20px (size-5)
  If we're having ui-* system control size,
    might as well let it control color/hover-color too
    (since the icon's line thickness might dictate what color is good)
  ALWAYS HAVE popoverCloseClass have 'group' className,
    so icon's group-hover can be defined
  MAYBE in the future we'll come up with a callback system to allow theme-* to define icon's styling better
IMPORTANT: all icon containers (buttonClass/popoverCloseClass/resourceExpanderClass)
  should have `inline-flex flex-row` to tamp-out line-height causing too tall
  always put `group` so can style icon based on group-hover group-focus-visible
resourceExpanderClass
  theme can choose size. usually size-4 or size-5
  always put `group` so can style icon based on group-hover group-focus-visible
