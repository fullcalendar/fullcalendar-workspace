Publishing:
  pnpm changeset publish --no-git-tag
  (next version should be v7.0.0-beta.3 because beta.2 was taken by the angular hotfix..
  ..write release/changelog for that)
  Angular beta repro:
  https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-sphfu1?file=package.json,src%2Findex.html

Print Mode
  No API changes. Simply make all views more-accurately render in print-mode. Possible with new techniques.
  Move towards fc-print-* classNames that don't need to be conditionally applied; they are themselves conditional
  FIX: text centering in header cells when fc-flex-col disabled on print
  INVESTIGATE: in Safari/Chrome, Timegrid view (which doesn't do crazy print-header),
    positions event y position off by 1px/2px on second page. happens because it forces the top
    border on the view's root element, even when it doesn't want it!
  todo: more investigation
  There will be known-bugs:
    - On Safari, table headers are not repeated for any view (browser bug)
    - On Chrome, for timegrid, table headers are sometimes covered by events
    - On Firefox, for timeline, vertical slot lines only show for first page
  DayGrid
    move week number within first daycell
      better for 'basic' rendering and better for pushing down eventcontainers if big
      either use floats (bad for react-native) or conditionally apply justify-content: flex-end/space-between
    use margin-top to position events (better for <td> event rendering)
      and normalize common y-position by setting top MARGIN on eventcontainers below not-so-tall dayheaders
    for rows, put border on bottom instead of top, so 2nd-page top border doesn't double-up with header
      also looks better then last row has extra space at bottom of page
  print-view for multimonth will be weird
  BUG
    scroll not restored after print-view
  TEST
    on DayGridHeader, dates-BELOW-resources don't have resource ID, did they ever?
      did their customer-render-func ever get passed a resource?
    test that last row of DayGridHeader is sticky
    just like events conditionally are <a> tags, should make navlinks the same
  AFTER
    revert "hacks to get print-mode working, but some should be reverted"
  NOTES
    you must put absolutely positioned siblings first
      more guaranteed to go to second page than if after a long sibling with height
    Firefox: setting a bottom coordinate will NEVER wrap to subsequent pages
      problems with height:100% as well. height hardcoding often needed

DayGrid
  prevent DayGridCell headers from overflowing? makes really small calendars look better
  bug (print-view):
    for multi-day events, don't display title within non-start/end segs
  bug: weekNumbers on 1-row dayGrid views don't work
MultiMonth
  bug: multi-row events cutoff when +more in next row (multimonth-view-bug.html)
  Improve perf while switching years
TimeGrid
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg,
    make timegrid bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  i flipped the natural DOM order of slats and resource-lanes.. has any bad effects?
Timeline
  initialscroll for RTL is off-by-2 in wrong direction
  previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap
    for real? matters? add to changelog?
Resource DayGrid
  (none)
Resource Timeline
  bug: drag-n-drop auto-scroll very glitchy
  bug: when group-column resized really narrow, text isn't cropped like cells in resource rows
  i flipped the natural DOM order of slats and resource-lanes.. has any bad effects?
    TODO: do same concepct for timeline-no-resources
  column grouping, should expand to full height, but doesn't
    See bundle/examples/responsive.html
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg,
    make timeline bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible.
    see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
  change how column-resizing widths is distibuted?
    right now it's impossible to resize last column
    try to take width away from next column when expanding
  optimize rendering for lane top/bottom padding
  when there's a superheader, and 2 headers in timeline area, padding in headers looks too thick?
H-Scrolling Views
  ensure col-width-syncing doesn't have 1px-off problem
    queries inner-width, but when assigning to outer-width, does it add 1px?
List View
  eventually redo list-view (and find tickets -- better <a> tag wrapper. better stickiness)
    and redo empty-list message
General Responsive
  Hide event times (daygrid/timeline) if too small?
  should fc-padding-* classes be responsive, meaning related to font-size?
    for fc-daygrid-day-number/fc-daygrid-week-number too
  make ticket where popover is responsive?
Scrollbars
  bug: unnecessary vertical scrollbar in daygrid see issue-6749-related.html
  implement scroller padding rectangles
  Test horizontal scroll normalization (for isRTL) in variety of browsers
  See [scrollbar bug] for Resource Timeline
Performance
  why does TimelineLane::render get called 3 times initially?
  [ ] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/3003
    not rerendinering events that didn't change --- not fixed in v6 or v7-beta
  [?] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6199 (dateClick)
    V6 repro: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/OJKMLRR?editors=0010
    V7 has no real improvement
  "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
  hit-system: only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  this.detachInnerHeight() // should fire a 'null' height? yes! will cleanup any map listeners
  use css translateX/Y instead of top/left to prevent reflows
  user IntersectionObserver for DnD?
Angular
  Building example project gives warnings like
    Ignoring this import because ".." was marked as having no side effects
Locales
  audit all allDayText. there's no more max-width in the CSS. use allDayHtml with breaks if needed
Dist
  ensure outputted CSS doesn't have multiple :root declarations because of how we shifted vars.css around
Manual Testing
  Touch devices
Examples
  In each two-column layout, give the sidebar flex-shrink:0 and the main min-width:0
    Things are currently collapsing very strangely on a narrow screen (like stackblitz angular demo)
Last-minute features
  Can safely assume all RTL scrollbars are on left. Optimize what Scroller reports
  Try to strip out dom-geom.ts and scrollbar-width, tho used for auto-scrolling
  Calendar::updateSize return promise
  Change how liquid-height is done for a single-expanding region
    Normally:
      FIXED-AREAS: nothing
      LIQUID-AREAS: { flex-grow:1, min-height:0, flex-basis:0 }
      Needed for horizontal equal-width cell expansion; basis0 is important
    New technique:
      FIXED-AREAS: { flex-shrink:0 }
      LIQUID-AREAS: { flex-grow:1, min-height:0 }
      Good for layouts that are conditionally liquid-height
      Tho probably not as performant because need to compute the pre-squished AND post-squished layouts
Changelog

  remove <a> tags from events w/o url
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7675
    leverages `getEventRangeAnchorAttrs`
  v6 regressions fixed
    fc-timegrid-event-inset (white glow) was being applied to all events,
      and the top-level events with stackForward weren't being indented on the side
      DID SOMEONE post a bug report for this?
  v7 regressions
    NextJS ResizeObserver error: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7802
    border problem fixed: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/PoMOwdV?editors=0010
    timegrid axis is text-selectable
    timeline now-indicator div covering events: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7798
Freshdesk/GHIssues
  Fixed this issue of mousedown taking long time to recalculate style?
    https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9078
    Can see forced-reflow warning here too: bundle/examples-v7/issue-7677.html
  Make tickets for a new view with list-view underneath month calendar
  Check ticket for daygrid view with "dots"
  Need to split this issue
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/1037
    1. scrollreset (already implemented)
    2. scroll to current date or time
NOTES for later
  simplified axis with h-scrolling: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/rNXdrLm?editors=1100
Punt
  Drop-shadow under sticky header, timeline headers
  In timegrid, when date-selecting with mirror event, why are we rendering highlight?
  For timeline event-dnd, the mirror, should have white glow just like timegrid for when overlap other events
  lack of text-selectability: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5628
    TODO: need larger discussion on whether dates w/ dateClick or events w/ eventClick
      should allow text-selection or now
  file bug for strange dragging events from timeline more-link (preexists)
  (same with TIMEGRID's more popover)
    https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/jOgeGwm?editors=0010
  timeline event dragging loses duration:
    1. have +more link with eventMaxStack
    2. open link, begin to drag event
    3. event looses it's duration. inconsistent with how normal event dragging happens
    (will be breaking change? maybe file ticket and add changelog)
    PREEXISTS: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/jOgeGwm?editors=0010
  Markup/CSS/structure
    kill fc-header-cell classname? ppl can just target `.fc-table-header .fc-table-cell`?
    in future css className refactor:
      fc-dayGridMonth -> fc-daygridmonth (to match fc-daygrid)
      fc-dayGridMonth-button -> fc-daygridmonth-button
      fc-timeline-now-indicator-arrow -> fc-timeline-nowindicator-arrow
      fc-timeline-more-link -> fc-timeline-morelink
      NEVERMIND. we've developed a strong precedent of dash-breaking-words,
        like week-number/day-number which needs to be both subcomponent (fc-daygrid-day>fc-daygrid-day-number)
        and independent component (fc-daygrid-week-number)

ensure automated tests for...
  positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
  resource-timeline indent works
  pixel # for height/contentHeight works
  correct header row heights for multi-header resource-TIMEgrid row with horizontal scrolling
  when nowIndicator is OFF, doesn't render in DOM at all
  percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
  that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views
  test datagrid with h scroll, but timeline area WITHOUT h scroll
  multiple tiers of headers line-up across scrollers
    timegrid h-scroll. with and without weekNumber
    resource-timeline. w/ datagrid/timeline headers: 1/2, 2/1
