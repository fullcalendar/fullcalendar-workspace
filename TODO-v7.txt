General Positioning Quirkiness
  Calendar::updateSize should have a flushSync and run in a loop
    Wouldn't need repeated updateSize hacks, (multiMonth-events.ts, more-link.ts, dayGrid-events.ts)
  ResizeObserver errors, solved by Calendar::updateSize calls in callback
    Investigate why
General Performance
  [ ] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/3003
    not rerendinering events that didn't change --- not fixed in v6 or v7-beta
  [?] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6199 (dateClick)
    V6 repro: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/OJKMLRR?editors=0010
    V7 has no real improvement
General Structure
  should be fc-timegrid(-view) on fc-resource-timegrid(-view), etc?
    similar: dumb how there's a fc-resource-daygrid-view and fc-daygrid. pick one or the other!
  Easily remove border from view-area. Possible in prior versions
DayGrid
  [structure] weekNumbers in daygrid should be in DOM-order before cells
  [structure] simplify event positioning
    normalize each event-container's top by applying margin-top on ones that have smaller headers
    position each event-harness with a margin-top (in combo with existing abs positioning)
    after this^, we'll know the explicit min-height a row should be
      TODO: use this to explicitly set min-height on row div, this will override the not-smart
      "default" that the browser decides. then, force min-height:0 for all flex items (same with min-width),
      to be more like react-native, and more intuitive
TimeGrid
  scrollTime:0
    doesn't actually start out as 0. write automated test?
  [structure] put data-time on fc-timegrid-slot div (the "row" with the border)
    will need to modify TimeGridWrapper::getTimeAxisInfo classNames
Resource Timeline
  [structure] when no groupcols, do simplified DOM structure?
  [structure] on datagrid, if fc-resource is on the cells, data-resource-id should NOT be on the row

Manual Test
-----------

Touch devices
been having issues with scrollwheel getting scrollsyncing out of whack!?

Release Prep
------------

ensure outputted CSS doesn't have multiple :root declarations because of how we shifted vars.css around
revert "hacks to get print-mode working, but some should be reverted"
revert temporary gitignores

Automated Test TODO
-------------------

how an event can render as a/div/div[role=button]
weird list-view slicing logic we removed
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/blob/9a0edaeb5eddf2cec8bd2409ecc26c4598b98a48/packages/list/src/ListView.tsx#L235-L249
resource-timeline rowgrouping
  has correct borders on bottom of rows, even when all row groups collapsed
  when expandRows: true, groups do not expand, only resources!
timeline/hscroll-timeGRID, when sticky-header
  ensure time-axis or resource area has bottom filler to match horizontal scrollbar
resource-timeline group cells (that run vertically) have correct border, especially 2nd and 3rd down
positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
resource-timeline indent works
pixel # for height/contentHeight works
correct header row heights for multi-header resource-TIMEgrid row with horizontal scrolling
when nowIndicator is OFF, doesn't render in DOM at all
percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views
test datagrid with h scroll, but timeline area WITHOUT h scroll
multiple tiers of headers line-up across scrollers
  timegrid h-scroll. with and without weekNumber
  resource-timeline. w/ datagrid/timeline headers: 1/2, 2/1
disabled days
  do NOT render navlinks (header or obviously day number)
  the headers WILL render data-date, fc-day-disabled (but not dayofweek, past, future classNames)
audit all past a11y bugs that aren't picked up by audit tool
  such as https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7566
  "The div and span elements have an implicit role of generic and cannot be named unless they have a role attribute."
aria-current='date' on today
no empty header cells
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/2536#issuecomment-703825166
[v7-beta] Day cells do not expand to fit events in dayGridYear
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7852
[resource-timeline] timeline-lane-footer has padding when eventOverlap:true, no padding when false
[timeline-no-resources] always has timeline-lane-footer, especially for when zero events and height:auto
timeline-event-rendering.ts, disabled test because flawed
  about zoom and event aligning w/ start and end

Changelog TODO
--------------

Make difference between API-breaking changes and Visually-breaking changes
Add: Bootstrap4/5 line-height less chunky
Add: Bootstrap
  Minimum Bootstrap5 version is 5.2.x
  Bootstrap5 now a peer dependency (and popver by assoc). not the case for 4. TODO: modify docs.
  Semantic color vars: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7465
  Looks good with Dark Mode
Document better dark-mode abilities for anyone, with CSS vars that Bootstrap5 happens to manipulate
Add: all cell headers, in all views, are no longer bold
Add: list-view nicer-looking stickyHeaderDates
Add: standin events get put through eventContent/etc
Add: eventSlicing (write tests too)
  eventSlicing:true (request: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6187)
  eventSlicing:false (request: https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9203)
Add: no longer use semantic tags (a for navlink, h2 for title), instead using aria
Add: i18n: removed eventHint/timeHint - were put on list-view fake column headers
  TODO: update all locales
Add: i18n: added timedText for rowHeader on timegrid timed-event row
  TODO: update all locales
Add: week-numbers no longer shown when only one DayGrid row
Add: removed data-navlink attribute in favor of fc-navlink className
Add: no longer use <a> tags in markup. instead use role=link/button
Regression: [v7-beta] Day cells do not expand to fit events in dayGridYear #7852
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7852
[fixed v7] DayGrid with height:auto "shows ResizeObserver loop warning"
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7861
Add: "all-day" text in TimeGrid respects newlines in locales' allDayText, looks better
  Also, better text-align looks better
TODO: for daygrid/timegrid header,
  resources under days have day classnames now, and data-date
  days under resources have fc-resource now, and data-resource-id
TODO: for dayGrid-DAY, AND dayGrid that has single-row
  no longer displays week number (because no space to put it)
TODO: for resource-timeGrid-DAY
  no longer displays week number (because would be alongside the resource headers)
Perf: switching multi-month years prev/next feels much snappier

Freshdesk/GH-issues
-------------------

Fixed this issue of mousedown taking long time to recalculate style?
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9078
  Can see forced-reflow warning here too: bundle/examples-v7/issue-7677.html
Make tickets for a new view with list-view underneath month calendar
Check ticket for daygrid view with "dots"
Need to split this issue
  https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/1037
  1. scrollreset (already implemented)
  2. scroll to current date or time
when infinite scroll-loading done
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9668
when virtual rendering done
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/8496
  https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9701
make ticket where +more popover is responsive? (takes up whole phone screen)
file bug for strange dragging events from timeline more-link (preexists)
timeline event dragging loses duration:
  1. have +more link with eventMaxStack
  2. open link, begin to drag event
  3. event looses it's duration. inconsistent with how normal event dragging happens
  (will be breaking change? maybe file ticket and add changelog)
  PREEXISTS: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/jOgeGwm?editors=0010
file preexisting v6 bug:
  non-singular view duration unit has weird hints on buttons "This ", "Next ", "Previous "
  https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/yyBpopg?editors=0010
TimeGrid
  Known visual regression with event positioning
    After implementing restored v4 timegrid event spacing (https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6569),
    Events squish too much:
      v4: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/pvzLNKr?editors=001 (BAD)
      v5: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/YPKapao?editors=0010 (GOOD)
      v6: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/NPKYbYb?editors=0010 (GOOD)
      v7: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/wBwJmgg?editors=001 (BAD)

Punt
----

General Markup
  viewharness
    implement aspect-ratio more literally
    maybe put fc-border on viewharness or viewcontainer
  kill fc-header-cell classname?
  in future css className refactor:
    fc-dayGridMonth -> fc-daygridmonth (to match fc-daygrid)
    fc-dayGridMonth-button -> fc-daygridmonth-button
    fc-timeline-now-indicator-arrow -> fc-timeline-nowindicator-arrow
    fc-timeline-more-link -> fc-timeline-morelink
    NEVERMIND. we've developed a strong precedent of dash-breaking-words,
      like week-number/day-number which needs to be both subcomponent (fc-daygrid-day>fc-daygrid-day-number)
      and independent component (fc-daygrid-week-number)
  Drop-shadow under sticky header, timeline headers
General Responsive
  Hide event times (daygrid/timeline) if too small?
  should fc-padding-* classes be responsive, meaning related to font-size?
    for fc-daygrid-day-number/fc-daygrid-week-number too
General Performance
  use css translateX/Y instead of top/left to prevent reflows
  user IntersectionObserver for DnD?
  when there's no ref watching a dimension, don't attach resize observer to element
    example: simple Month-view always listens to header heights (innerHeightRef) because TimeGrid
    needs to sync height with all-day cell
General a11y
  have separate settings for date-format hints? out of whack
    view's aria-label (if no headerToolbar) is "Sep 7 – 8, 2020" (bad that it's abbreviated)
    week-view's column headers have hint "September 7, 2020" which don't include day of week (like real text "Mon 9/7")
  change <button> to role=button for fewer css reset collision?
  "Note: The aria-rowindex must be added to each row, but is optional on the cells, except for cells that span rows: the aria-rowindex attribute is required on all spanning cells."
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-rowindex
DayGrid
  prevent DayGridCell headers from overflowing? makes really small calendars look better
Resource Timeline
  get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible.
    see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
Angular
  Building example project gives warnings like
    Ignoring this import because ".." was marked as having no side effects
TimeGrid
  when date-selecting with mirror event, why are we rendering highlight?
  for timeline event-dnd, the mirror, should have white glow just like timegrid for when overlap other events
    https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/jOgeGwm?editors=0010
Timeline
  for timeline event-dnd, the mirror, should have white glow just like timegrid for when overlap other events
MultiMonth
  put navlink on multimonth month header text?
  For print, force +morelink to isCompact=true
    Starting out NOT compact in forced 2-col formation, but when gets squished to where isCompact
    is needed, but ResizeObserver/etc doesn't adapt. examples-v7/multimonth-view.html
Cross-browser
  Firefox
    [bug][regression]: after print-view (for timegrid as least) scroll gutter filler permanently disappears
      does not happen when rigging up "P" keystroke
    Re-address borderBoxSize HACK
    resource-timeline header borders a little messed up
  Safari
    [bug] shows ResizeObserver loop warning
      when moving from resourceTimelineDay -> resourceTimelineThreeDays
        when timeline header gains a level and gets taller
        probably related to totalBodyOuterHeight hackiness
  Chrome
    [bug] with timeline sticky multi-tier date text
      premium/bundle/examples/timeline-sticky-header.html
      1. Click 3-day view
      2. Resize resource area
      3. "Sat 1/7" flickers and changes position
Example Projects
  In each two-column layout, give the sidebar flex-shrink:0 and the main min-width:0
    Things are currently collapsing very strangely on a narrow screen (like stackblitz angular demo)

Notes
-----

we really do care about minimizing resizerobserver loops, prevents flicker. so, safari is valuable
flexbox row expansion works across scroll regions: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/rNXdrLm?editors=1100
100% width within scroller applies to clientWidth only: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/GgKWRNZ?editors=1100
Print
  if you hit the debugging 'p' to force print-mode too soon after you stop scrolling,
    scrollEnd won't have enough time to fire and scroll state likely won't be saved,
    resulting in jump when entering print-mode. however, this isn't a realistic scenario because
    usually users have a long time between when they stop scrolling and when they initiate printing
  translateX/Y doesn't work when sticky items inside
  siblings must all be absolutely positioned if they are supposed to overlap
    and if you want them to span to subsequent pages in-sync
  Firefox:
    sometimes you just need to restart Firefox and things start working :(
    setting a bottom coordinate will NEVER wrap to subsequent pages
      problems with height:100% as well. hardcoded height needed
    weird issue: if abs positioned element starts on 2nd page and spans to third,
      makes a strange gap on 3rd page and pushes all content afterwards down
    if there's any sort of overflow:hidden/scroll container,
      screws up absolute positioning within, when spanning to subsequent pages. must disable
    JUST GIVE UP on multi-page absolutely positioned items in firefox
  bugzilla flexbox issues
    master ticket (pending): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=939897
    special-case fix (done): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=939897
      supposedly milestone 78.0a1
  bug with flexbox AND absolute positioning wrapping to subsequent pages (our discovery)
    ("Dinner" isn't showing up; starts on second page)
    (NEED TO LOOK AT ACTUAL PDF - differs from print preview sometimes)
      Firefox 120 - perfect
      Firefox 110 - good (event y off by 1px)
      Firefox 100 - good (event y off by 1px)
      Firefox 97 - good (event y off by 1px) --- February 8, 2022
      Firefox 96 - bad
      Firefox 95 - bad
      Firefox 90 - bad
  known-bugs:
    On Safari, table headers are not repeated for any view (browser bug)
a11y tree considerations
  aria-controls on resource-timeline parent-toggler
    is difficult because a parent row could control MANY child rows, and we don't have wrappers for
    those children, so aria-controls would need to be a huge dynamic list of tokens
  additional aria
    aria-level (depth)
    aria-posinset (index in current set)
    aria-setsize (current set size, not child size)
    ***I wanted to do this, but if rows out of order (because of virtualization),
      then no way to establish parent/child relationships
Why we need to use a <Ruler> to measure dimensions
  ResizeObserver does NOT synchronously handle dimension changes to self or ancestors while
  handling current element's dimensions. Will give a "ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications"
  error. Quintessential example is implementing an aspect-ratio element, which sets height of self after reading
  width of self. <Ruler> detangles dimension relationships and is very portable.

How to do liquid-width/height, multiple technique
  Classic performant technique (currently used):
    FIXED-AREAS: nothing
    LIQUID-AREAS: { flex-grow:1, min-height:0, flex-basis:0 }
    Needed for horizontal equal-width cell expansion; basis0 is important
  Experimental:
    FIXED-AREAS: { flex-shrink:0 }
    LIQUID-AREAS: { flex-grow:1, min-height:0 }
    Good for layouts that are conditionally liquid-height
    Tho probably not as performant because need to compute the pre-squished AND post-squished layouts
