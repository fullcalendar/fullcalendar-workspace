Publishing:
 pnpm changeset publish --no-git-tag
 (next version should be v7.0.0-beta.3 because beta.2 was taken by the angular hotfix..
 ..write release/changelog for that)
 Angular beta repro:
  https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-sphfu1?file=package.json,src%2Findex.html

Theming
  Bootstrap color mode:
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7465
    ensure minimum Bootstrap version
  in bootstrap themes, event-height line-height is very tall. normalize? then make changelog entry?
DayGrid
  bug (print-view):
    for multi-day events, don't display title within non-start/end segs
MultiMonth
  bug: when multimonth made REALLY small, single col month gets padding
    standard/bundle/examples/responsive.html
  bug w/ responsive:
    1. start out in different view, size window really small
    2. switch to multimonth, size window large
    3. multi-columns don't appear. just one column with vertically-squished months
  Since we moved to a normal Scroller instead of a force-vertical-scrollbar div,
    is there a chance of infinite dimension-to-state loop?
TimeGrid
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg,
    make timegrid bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  weird event overlapping problem (see Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 1.54.57â€¯PM.png)
    10am event (1 hour) gets overlapped by 8am-2pm event (6 hours)
Timeline
  v7 regression for timeline event dragging?:
    1. have +more link with eventMaxStack
    2. open link, begin to drag event
    3. event looses it's duration. inconsistent with how normal event dragging happens
    (will be breaking change? maybe file ticket and add changelog)
  Is the event style in timeline-no-overlap.html too chunky?
  previously, Timeline's hit system would always return slat left/right, not snap
    for real? matters? add to changelog?
  Did +more links in timeline always have strict order (meaning they were at bottom?). Regression?
Resource DayGrid
  bug w/ `bundle/examples-v7/resource-daygrid.html` when dragging event3 one day ahead,
    would result in a +more link that'd disappear when you return, but after we refactor DayGrid rendering, should be fixed
Resource Timeline
  bug: in `examples/resource-add-remove.html`, when deleting Auditorium D, collapses strangely after
  bug: when resourceAreaHeaderContent, and multiple datagrid-columns, super-header's indent is unnecessary. looks bad
  column grouping, should expand to full height, but doesn't
    See bundle/examples/responsive.html
  just like scrollbar dead area should have grey bg,
    make timeline bottom area w/o slots a grey bg
  get grouping via row and col simultaneously working. should be possible.
    see timeline-row-n-col-grouping-not-working.html
  ensure row-height-syncing doesn't have 1px-off problem
    queries inner-height, but when assigning to outer-height, does it add 1px?
  change how column-resizing widths is distibuted?
    right now it's impossible to resize last column
    try to take width away from next column when expanding
  optimize rendering for lane top/bottom padding
  when there's a superheader, and 2 headers in timeline area, padding in headers looks too thick?
  in resource-timeline splitpane,
    should RTL scrollbars that appear on RIGHT, happen on datagrid!? yes
      (keep in mind columns are reversed)
H-Scrolling Views
  ensure col-width-syncing doesn't have 1px-off problem
    queries inner-width, but when assigning to outer-width, does it add 1px?
List View
  eventually redo list-view (and find tickets -- better <a> tag wrapper. better stickiness)
    and redo empty-list message
Print Mode
  ensure no white text
  ensure nothing sticky
    (wait, maybe we want it titles sticky onscreen for h-scroll daygrid/timeline)
  DayGrid: disable dayMaxEvents=true behavior
  DayGrid: ensure: "event titles each day" https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6657
  disable sticky when media:print?
General Responsive
  Hide event times (daygrid/timeline) if too small?
  should fc-padding-* classes be responsive, meaning related to font-size?
    for fc-daygrid-cell-number/fc-daygrid-week-number too
  make ticket where popover is responsive?
Scrollbars
  bug: unnecessary vertical scrollbar in daygrid see issue-6749-related.html
  implement scroller padding rectangles
  Test horizontal scroll normalization (for isRTL) in variety of browsers
  See [scrollbar bug] for Resource Timeline
Markup/CSS/structure
  .fc-timegrid-col-fg -> .fc-timegrid-col-events, like DayGrid?
  .fc-daygrid-cell-number is an awkward classname... fc-daygrid-day-number instead? fc-daygrid-datenumber/daynumber?
  in future css className refactor:
    fc-dayGridMonth -> fc-daygridmonth (to match fc-daygrid)
    fc-dayGridMonth-button -> fc-daygridmonth-button
    fc-timeline-now-indicator-arrow -> fc-timeline-nowindicator-arrow
    fc-timeline-more-link -> fc-timeline-morelink
Performance
  why does TimelineLane::render get called 3 times initially?
  [ ] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/3003
    not rerendinering events that didn't change --- not fixed in v6 or v7-beta
  [?] https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6199 (dateClick)
    V6 repro: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/OJKMLRR?editors=0010
    V7 has no real improvement
  "Maximum update depth exceeded" error after resizing many times in Chrome --- reemerged?
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5606
  hit-system: only query DOM element for handlers like dayClick at very end
  this.detachInnerHeight() // should fire a 'null' height? yes! will cleanup any map listeners
  use css translateX/Y instead of top/left to prevent reflows
  user IntersectionObserver for DnD?
Angular
  Building example project gives warnings like
    Ignoring this import because ".." was marked as having no side effects
Locales
  audit all allDayText. there's no more max-width in the CSS. use allDayHtml with breaks if needed
Dist
  ensure outputted CSS doesn't have multiple :root declarations because of how we shifted vars.css around
Manual Testing
  Touch devices
Dev Cleanup
  Remove unused css mixins
  Why is week-numbers.html example in premium? has nothing to do with premium
Examples
  In each two-column layout, give the sidebar flex-shrink:0 and the main min-width:0
    Things are currently collapsing very strangely on a narrow screen (like stackblitz angular demo)
Last-minute features
  Calendar::updateSize return promise
  Drop-shadow under sticky header, timeline headers
  In timegrid, when date-selecting with mirror event, why are we rendering highlight?
  For timeline event-dnd, the mirror, should have white glow just like timegrid for when overlap other events
Changelog
  Add: Calendar::updateSize no longer synchronous
  Add: all cell headers are no longer bold
  Add: standin events get put through eventContent/etc
  Add: eventSlicing (write tests too)
    eventSlicing:true (request: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/6187)
    eventSlicing:false (request: https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9203)
  remove <a> tags from events w/o url
    https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7675
    leverages `getEventRangeAnchorAttrs`
  v6 regressions fixed
    fc-timegrid-event-inset (white glow) was being applied to all events,
      and the top-level events with stackForward weren't being indented on the side
      DID SOMEONE post a bug report for this?
  v7 regressions
    NextJS ResizeObserver error: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7802
    border problem fixed: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/PoMOwdV?editors=0010
    timegrid axis is text-selectable
    timeline now-indicator div covering events: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/7798
Support Tickets
  Fixed this issue of mousedown taking long time to recalculate style?
    https://fullcalendar.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/9078
    Can see forced-reflow warning here too: bundle/examples-v7/issue-7677.html
  Make tickets for a new view with list-view underneath month calendar
  Check ticket for daygrid view with "dots"
NOTES for later
  simplified axis with h-scrolling: https://codepen.io/arshaw/pen/rNXdrLm?editors=1100
Punt
  lack of text-selectability: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5628
    TODO: need larger discussion on whether dates w/ dateClick or events w/ eventClick
      should allow text-selection or now

ensure automated tests for...
  positioning of sticky headers in all views. list view sticky subheaders too
  resource-timeline indent works
  pixel # for height/contentHeight works
  correct header row heights for multi-header resource-TIMEgrid row with horizontal scrolling
  when nowIndicator is OFF, doesn't render in DOM at all
  percentage-based resource-timeline spreadsheet-column resizing
  that expandRows works enabled/disabled for timegrid/resource-timeline views
  test datagrid with h scroll, but timeline area WITHOUT h scroll
  multiple tiers of headers line-up across scrollers
    timegrid h-scroll. with and without weekNumber
    resource-timeline. w/ datagrid/timeline headers: 1/2, 2/1
