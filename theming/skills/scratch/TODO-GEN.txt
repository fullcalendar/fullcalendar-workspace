css reset for non-tailwind
  how will we do line-height reset in non-tailwind? (and have it work in tailwind too)


default UI (VANILLA)
  plugin - YES - empty toolbar by default
  tailwind copypasta - NO - how would subclassing `new Calendar` work anyway!?
REACT default UI
  plugin - NO - ppl should just use default UI plugin
  tailwind copypasta - YES - w/ opinionated toolbar that can be adjusted
SHADCN
  plugin - NO - against philosophy
  tailwind copypasta - YES - w/ opinionated toolbar that can be adjusted
MUI
  plugin - NO - not possible to define outer-box that matches with theme
  tailwind copypasta - NO - not idiomatic MUI, maybe later
  DO: provide components
    EventCalendar/Scheduler (has addButton props)
    EventCalendarView/SchedulerView (dev must make wrapping box and toolbars)
