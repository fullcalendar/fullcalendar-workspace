css reset for non-tailwind
  how will we do line-height reset in non-tailwind? (and have it work in tailwind too)

when transforming to Shadcn
  user cn() instead of joinClassNames()

default UI (VANILLA)
  plugin - YES - empty toolbar by default
  tailwind copypasta - NO - how would subclassing `new Calendar` work anyway!?
REACT default UI
  plugin - NO - ppl should just use default UI plugin
  tailwind copypasta - YES - w/ opinionated toolbar that can be adjusted
SHADCN
  plugin - NO - against philosophy
  tailwind copypasta - YES - w/ opinionated toolbar that can be adjusted
MUI
  plugin - NO - not possible to define outer-box that matches with theme
  tailwind copypasta - NO - not idiomatic MUI, maybe later
  DO: provide components
    EventCalendar/Scheduler (has addButton props)
    EventCalendarView/SchedulerView (dev must make wrapping box and toolbars)

How to make gen/src structure?
  theme-breezy/
    src/
      plugin.ts
      *.ts (tailwind src)
      _gen-plugin/ (tailwind converted to ts/vanilla-css)
    _gen-plugin-dist -> symlink (use a tsconfig.gen-plugin.json that extends tsconfig.json)
  ui-default-REACT/
    src/theme-breezy/
    src/_gen-tailwind/theme-breezy/ (tailwind compiled)
  ui-shadcn/
    src/theme-breezy/
    src/_gen-tailwind/theme-breezy/ (tailwind compiled)
  ui-mui/
    src/theme-breezy/
    src/_gen-components/theme-breezy/ (tailwind converted to ts/vanilla-css)

How to do "tailwind converted to vanilla css" ?
  ask plugin.ts to inline into _gen-plugin/index.ts (keeping tailwind)
  [OR] ask src/theme-breezy/* components to inline into src/_gen-components/theme-breezy/* (keeping tailwind)
  create empty css file (global.css)
  use AI to simultaneously fctw- prefix and externalize to global.css
  write script to obfuscate all fctw- classnames (both in js and global.css)
  convert rem -> em, add our resets

How to have standard repo use themes from outer workspace?
  things that use classic-theme in standard subrepo:
    automated tests
    bundle/examples/
    ^^^built bundle from that stuff





UI-DEFAULT(VANILLA-JS)
/theming/theme-*/src/index.ts --- plugin
/theming/theme-*/src/_gen/css-tailwind/index.ts --- compiled. unused interum
(use AI to simultaneously fctw- prefix and externalize)
(write script to obfuscate all fctw- classnames)
(convert rem -> em, add our reset)
/theming/theme-*/src/_gen/css-vanilla/index.ts --- plugin. does NOT import .css file
/theming/theme-*/src/_gen/css-vanilla/global.css --- where above fctw- stuff dumped css
/theming/theme-*/src/_gen/css-vanilla/global.ts --- copied and pasted, just globally installs plugin
/theming/theme-*/dist/index.(js|d.ts) and global.(js|d.ts|css)

UI-DEFAULT(REACT) --- private package
/theming/ui-default-react/src/theme-*/(event-calendar|scheduler).tsx
/theming/ui-default-react/src/_gen/theme-*/css-tailwind/(event-calendar|scheduler).tsx --- compiled
--- no "dist" because React users can just use vanilla-js plugin

mui
/theming/ui-mui/src/theme-*/(EventCalendar|Scheduler).tsx
/theming/ui-mui/src/_gen/theme-*/css-tailwind/(EventCalendar|Scheduler).tsx --- compiled
(use AI to simultaneously fctw- prefix and externalize)
(write script to obfuscate all fctw- classnames)
(convert rem -> em, add our reset)
/theming/ui-mui/src/_gen/theme-*/css-vanilla/(EventCalendar|Scheduler).tsx
/theming/ui-mui/src/_gen/theme-*/css-vanilla/global.css --- where above fctw- stuff dumped css
/theming/ui-mui/dist/(EventCalendar|Scheduler).(js|d.ts) and global.css

SHADCN --- private package
/theming/ui-shadcn/src/theme-*/(event-calendar|scheduler).tsx
/theming/ui-shadcn/src/_gen/theme-*/(event-calendar|scheduler).tsx --- assumed tailwind. compiled
--- no "dist" because Shadcn is ALWAYS copy and paste


create demo-vanilla-js, pull from plugins
have demo-react pull from css-vanilla AND *compiled* css-tailwind
have both demos test RTL with toggle






STRATEGY FOR COMPILING THEME SOURCE CODE TO A SINGLE INLINED REACT COMPONENT

- Inline all theming and slot logic from theme packages, but do NOT inline core or connector packages (e.g., @fullcalendar/core, @fullcalendar/react).
- Inline all option objects (e.g., baseEventCalendarOptions, defaultUiEventCalendarOptions) as explicit JSX props on the main component, not as object spreads.
- Merge user options shallowly: spread user props (e.g., {...options}) before custom props to avoid overwriting custom logic.
- For the 'views' and 'buttons' props, merge user and theme options per-key: spread user options first, then override/add theme defaults for each sub-object (e.g., dayGrid, prev, next, etc.), so user options take precedence. Use the same shallow merging strategy for each sub-object.
- When spreading user options for nested objects (like views, buttons, or any similar prop), you can use ...options.views (etc.) or ...options.views?.dayGrid without a fallback, as the spread operator handles undefined/null gracefully. This is preferred over ...((options.views && options.views.dayGrid) || {}).
- Use top-level constants for all constant values (e.g., colors, class names, static option values).
- DRY: Use variables for repeated logic/functions (e.g., rowItemClasses, getWeekNumberBadgeClasses), do not inline the same logic in multiple places.
- Inline JSX-generating functions (e.g., dayHeaderContent) directly as JSX props, not as separate variables, and intermix them with related className/structure props in the component declaration (not grouped at the end). Order them for best readability and logical grouping.
- Remove all unused variables and code after inlining or refactoring.
- Use concise JSX for string literals (e.g., className="foo" not className={"foo"}).
- Do NOT leave any intermediate, inlining, or strategy comments in the code body—keep the output clean and production-ready.
- Keep the output idiomatic for React and easy to maintain.
- Always clean up after inlining or refactoring, ensuring no dead code remains.
- Prefer explicitness and maintainability over cleverness or terseness.
- When using FullCalendar plugins (such as timeline, resource, adaptive, etc.), you must explicitly import them and include them in the plugins={[]} prop of the generated component. This is required for correct operation and is not handled automatically by FullCalendar.

This strategy ensures the resulting file is a single, self-contained, idiomatic React component that is easy to read, maintain, and override.
