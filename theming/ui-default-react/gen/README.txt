STRATEGY FOR COMPILING THEME SOURCE CODE TO A SINGLE INLINED REACT COMPONENT

- Inline all theming and slot logic from theme packages, but do NOT inline core or connector packages (e.g., @fullcalendar/core, @fullcalendar/react).
- Inline all option objects (e.g., baseEventCalendarOptions, defaultUiEventCalendarOptions) as explicit JSX props on the main component, not as object spreads.
- Merge user options shallowly: spread user props (e.g., {...options}) before custom props to avoid overwriting custom logic.
- For the 'views' and 'buttons' props, merge user and theme options per-key: spread user options first, then override/add theme defaults for each sub-object (e.g., dayGrid, prev, next, etc.), so user options take precedence. Use the same shallow merging strategy for each sub-object.
- When spreading user options for nested objects (like views, buttons, or any similar prop), you can use ...options.views (etc.) or ...options.views?.dayGrid without a fallback, as the spread operator handles undefined/null gracefully. This is preferred over ...((options.views && options.views.dayGrid) || {}).
- Use top-level constants for all constant values (e.g., colors, class names, static option values).
- DRY: Use variables for repeated logic/functions (e.g., rowItemClasses, getWeekNumberBadgeClasses), do not inline the same logic in multiple places.
- Inline JSX-generating functions (e.g., dayHeaderContent) directly as JSX props, not as separate variables, and intermix them with related className/structure props in the component declaration (not grouped at the end). Order them for best readability and logical grouping.
- Remove all unused variables and code after inlining or refactoring.
- Use concise JSX for string literals (e.g., className="foo" not className={"foo"}).
- Do NOT leave any intermediate, inlining, or strategy comments in the code bodyâ€”keep the output clean and production-ready.
- Keep the output idiomatic for React and easy to maintain.
- Always clean up after inlining or refactoring, ensuring no dead code remains.
- Prefer explicitness and maintainability over cleverness or terseness.
- When using FullCalendar plugins (such as timeline, resource, adaptive, etc.), you must explicitly import them and include them in the plugins={[]} prop of the generated component. This is required for correct operation and is not handled automatically by FullCalendar.

This strategy ensures the resulting file is a single, self-contained, idiomatic React component that is easy to read, maintain, and override.
