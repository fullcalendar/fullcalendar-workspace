# Full UI :: Headless Calendar

Headless calendar library by the makers of FullCalendar

## Description

This library is a higher-level abstraction than a datetime library (like Moment or date-fns), but not high enough to be considered a batteries-included calendar/scheduler library. It gives developers the power to create their own datetime-based UI using a set of convenient utility methods and objects, similar to what Tanstack Table does for data grids.

In its current form, it's being used internally by the `@fullcalendar/core` package. We have ambitions to make it more robust and feature-packed while keeping a small tree-shakeable size. It's functionality is not yet thoroughly document, though for select FullCalendar Premium users, we are offering this as beta software to overcome limitations with FullCalendar's current lack of composability.

## High-level API

- Date parsing/validation
- Event object parsing/validation
- Event object slicing and other kung-fu needed to make event display conform to a variety of DOM structures
- A little bit of cross-framework magic

And more to come!... 👀
