# FullCalendar React 18 + Redux Example Project

For complete instructions on how to initialize your build system, see the [FullCalendar React Docs &raquo;](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/react)

**About this example:** the state for events is owned by a [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) store and reducer. This technique is more tedious to set up than the [simple technique](../react) but allows the state to be accessed when a FullCalendar component is not rendered.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-examples.git
cd fullcalendar-examples/react18-redux

## Build Commands

```bash

# other commands:

```
