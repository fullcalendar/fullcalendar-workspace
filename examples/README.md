# FullCalendar Example Projects

A collection of simple example projects to show how to use FullCalendar with various build setups.

Please read the README in each project subdirectory.

## Monorepo Hack

We use [`dependenciesMeta.*.injected`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#dependenciesmetainjected) to inline our connector packages so peerDependencies don't get confused.

**RULE:** For any example projects that do NOT use a given connector's UI framework devDependency version, do `dependenciesMeta.*.injected`. However, if there's already a version match, do NOT do this (has been shown to introduce complications).

  - Exception: `react19` does not need this. Breaks in fact. Vite might be deduping peerDependencies.

**RULE:** For above-mentioned defacto UI framework versions, ensure same version across all package dependencies.

**GOTCHA:** Run `pnpm install` at root after building connectors to correctly sync the inlined version.
