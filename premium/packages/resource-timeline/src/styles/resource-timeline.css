// HACK to get fc-timeline-lane-misc above the background but under the events container
// We can't insert fc-timeline-lane-misc inbetween DOM-wise because TimelineLane is one Fragment
.fc-timeline-lane-misc {
  position: relative;
  z-index: $event-z; // above fc-timeline-slots
}

.fc-timeline-lane-overlap-enabled .fc-timeline-lane-footer {
