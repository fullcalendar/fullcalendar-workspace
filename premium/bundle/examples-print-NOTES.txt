Firefox looks terrible in print preview b/c lines are too thin, but actually fine

Sticky positioning that spans across document is never included in print

Q: does ResizeObserver not fire when print-mode activated?
  A: not only it doesn't fire, it's IMPOSSIBLE to get print-adjusted dimensions
     rendered in different universe

EXPERIMENTS:
  Chromium 130
    Month             : GOOD row splitting
    Month H-Scroll    : GOOD row splitting amidst h-scroll container
    TimeGrid          : GOOD abs slots across pages
    TimeGrid H-Scroll : GOOD abs slots across pages, SYNCED, but BUG with v-scroll syncing after returning from print-mode
    Resource Timeline : GOOD abs slots across pages
    & w/ Col Grouping   OKAYYY text shifted when resource-row split across 2 pages
  Safari 17.6
    Month             : GOOD row splitting
    Month H-Scroll    : GOOD row splitting amidst h-scroll container
    TimeGrid          : OKAYYY, but bug where scrollbar gutter in all-day and header don't get removed for print-mode
    TimeGrid H-Scroll : GOOD abs slots across pages
    Resource Timeline : GOOD, but bug where -no-bars isn't hiding the bottom h-scrollbars
    & w/ Col Grouping   OKAYYY text is spliced across pages, sometimes not readable
  Firefox 132
    Month             : GOOD row splitting
    Month H-Scroll    : GOOD row splitting amidst h-scroll container, BUT doesn't respect horizontal-scroll for <Scrollers>s!
    TimeGrid          : BAD, but any abs that starts on first page doesn't show on second, including events,
                        in fact, bottom-value gets force to align with page bottom (like a "max-bottom")
                        ALSO, bug where scrollbar gutter in all-day and header don't get removed for print-mode
                        ALSO, axis label text shifted when split across pages (like Chromium)
    TimeGrid H-Scroll : BAD, the splitpane abs all starts on *second* page, splits axis cells across pages strangely. NO-GO!
    Resource Timeline : BAD, the splitpane abs all starts on *second* page. NO-GO!
    & w/ Col Grouping     NOTE: if you try to set display:block everywhere, solves some problems but creates others

MORE EXPERIMENTS (results for these within the example-*.html files)
  <table> markup shows header/footer on multiple pages
  div with display:table-* shows header/footer on multiple pages
    table
    table-header-group
    table-footer-group
    table-row
    table-cell
  for either, if column widths hard coded, will they be collapsed in print view?
  does overflow:hidden work on cells?
